THE

CREATION

[i the beginning there was nothing except Enigwa, the supreme deity. His powers created the world of Juravia from the

emptiness of space and set it adrift within the universe. It was he who ignited the sun that would illuminate and heat this
world: It was he who breathed life into the animals and plants that would inhabit its surface. Devoted to detail in his labor, he
personally forged each mountain, planted each tree, chiseled each river. For ages he toiled and, in the end, his utopia was both
beautiful and ordered.

When at last his chore was complete, Enigwa bore his offspring, the gods. As children, these immortals were timid and
curious. They took to wandering about the world, exploring their father’s creation. They discovered the beautiful rainbows

and waterfalls, gazed on the green forests and out across the emerald oceans. During this time Enigwa slept, for he had grown

tired. During this great slumber, his offspring developed their individual personalities. They discovered their special gifts and
powers. Although most were good at heart, some became chaotic, others aggressive, still others lustful or greedy. These traits
intensified as time passed and they began to argue with each other, causing fights and dissension. Eventually, the creator
awoke from his slumber and summoned his children to his side. He smiled at them, as a kindly father does, and asked them

to clasp hands. It was then that father and children together created man.

Man was created in the image of Enigwa and was born with the supreme being’s creativity and passion. But man had also

been imbued with the personalities of the other gods. This instilled man with greed, arrogance, pride, and aggression. Enigwa
was blind to this corruption and, turning to his children, gave them a command. “Guide these mortals,” he said to his sons
and daughters. “Help them learn of the world and its wonders. Instruct them as teachers and watch over them as shepherds,”

he said. ” But do not teach them the craft of Magic, for Magic is the power of the divine alone and not meant for the ungodly.”

With those words, he vanished. He had other worlds to create. The only hint of his presence in the universe was the appearance

of each new star on the Curtain of Night.

THE

GREAT

WARS

| Sai produced many offspring, each one an immortal. These gods wandered about as man multiplied and spread
across Juravia. The gods’ power stemmed from Magic, a gift not given to man, and each god discovered his or her own

unique talent. They each could affect a different aspect of the world and, although some powers overlapped, each had their
own specialties and individual abilities.

In the absence of their father, their personalities began to emerge once more. Some of the immortals began harassing mankind,
enforcing their own will upon the mortals. Arguments erupted between the gods as some would govern man as teachers and
shepherds, while others would rule as dictators and overlords. As the quarrels began to flare, a triumvirate formed between
three brothers: Grom, Necros, and Galignen. All three of these immortals were corrupt and suspicious. They each possessed
a defined arrogance that made them lust for power and dominance. As they subjected the mortals to their whims, other gods

fought against them.

So consumed with arrogance was Grom that he attempted to create his own race of mortals to dominate and control. He found
that he lacked the power to bestow life. Alone, Grom could only alter what already existed. Displaying his powers, he twisted
man into abominable races. He created the Higmoni, the Berserkers and eventually the Giants. Using these creatures, he
forged an army and secured an area of Juravia as his own.
At first, the other gods were appalled by Grom’s defiance of Enigwa, but soon they too began to alter mankind in their own
images. They created both beautiful races and horrid half-breeds. Throughout the world, these races mingled. Wars erupted as
the pride and prejudice of man and humanoid emerged. Blood was spilled on countless battlefields. Berethenu and Shalmar,
the gods of justice and life, argued for a solution to end the chaos. But as the two spoke of peace, the triumvirate continued its
conquest for world domination.

Necros, god of death, was the only immortal incapable of altering life. This angered him beyond reason, sending him into

chaotic fits which resulted in the slaughter of more than one thousand mortals. It was during one of these episodes that he
created the undead, hidéous creatures of death. His unnatural creations withered in the sunlight and turned to dust. This
discovery intrigued the god of death and he convinced his allies to help him forge an army. Together, the three brothers
wanderedinto Mulkra, the fiery underworld that lay in the center of the planet. Necros animated. the dead mortals and created
an army of Skeletons, Zombies and other abominations. Protected from the sun, they existed within the darkness of Mulkra
until Necros could execute his plan.

By this time, the other gods had created their own races and even altered the landscapes of the world to suit their peoples.
Dense jungles were created, mountains were flattened, oceans were drained, all at the whim of Enigwa’s godling children.
Berethenu and Shalmar continued to protest these actions, but eventually, even Berethenu forged his own race. These demihumans, the Dwarves, were strong and defiant. They fought against the armies of Grom with sheer resolve, and Berethenu

fought beside them. Peace, at this point, could only be achieved through war! And the wars that followed destroyed the lands

of Juravia. Fertile fields were turned black by ash and char. Dense forests were leveled in the wake of the Great Wars. But even
as the armies of Grom were slowly beaten back, Necros initiated his plan.

Dembria, goddess of creation, was jealous of Shalmar, who was said to have been made from the beauty and warmth of the
sun. Manipulating Dembria, Necros convinced her to make the moon, which blotted out the sun’s light and cast Juravia into
darkness. The armies of Necros marched forward from Mulkra the instant the sun was blocked. Combined with the forces of

Grom, this unholy army proved far too strong for Berethenu. It appeared as though the Triumvirate would succeed and the
world would remain forever in twilight.

The arrogance of Grom and Necros was without end and they soon made many enemies. Marda, the goddess. of animals,
became enraged over the slaughter of her animals and of her humanoid race, the Merikii. In the deepest forest, she began
creating the monsters of the world, loosing them upon Juravia. Aggressive beyond reason, these monsters attacked all life,
killing anyone they encountered. In her divine wrath, she created the Dragons and unleashed them as well.
Even Kitharu, god of nature, who had been neutral throughout the entire ordeal, was repulsed by the arrogance and chaos. His
own race of Kithsara had been persecuted by the armies of Grom. Using -his powers, he summoned great storms that swept
across the world, altering forever the weather patterns Enigwa had established. Whole regions were laid waste by the intense,

climactic changes, and the armies of both Berethenu’and Grom suffered.

THE

TEACHING

OF

MAGIC

( en was the first to. teach Magic to mortals. He believed Magic would give his armies a great advantage

over those of Berethenu, Marda,-and Kitharu. These mortals were'called Grom Warriors. They killed for sport and for the

recognition of their god.

The other gods also began teaching magic. Soon, Marda had a-following of wizards known as Beast Mages, Necros had his

Necromancers, Dembria taught the Enchanters, and: Kitharu instructed the Elementalists: Even Berethenu began teaching his
magic to those who would learn. These mortals became known as,Berethenu Knights:

Through all this, Shalmar begged her brothers and sisters for peace. She alone remained true to her father, Enigwa, unaffected

by the fever that had consumed her siblings. She had not-altered the landscapes orscreated a race of her own, nor.had she
instructed men inher magic. Going to Necros, she pleaded with her younger brother that he stop the chaos. He answered by
stabbing Shalmar through the heart. When her lifeless body struck the ground, the god of death could only smile.

THE

BANISHMENT

Wee Enigwa returned to Juravia, his eyes immediately fell upon the moon that blotted out-the sun, and he scowleds
Steppitig foot onthe world, he found that his landscapes had’been altered and he was-angered. His eyes fell upon the
humanoids that were twisted from his chosen race and he was enraged. He witnessed the mortals using magic, which kindled

his wrath, and in horror gazed upon the wars that continued to rage across Juravia. When at last he came upon the body of

Shalmar, twisted and broken, his violence exploded, causing the world to quake and the oceans to boil.

With a single shout, the wars ceased and the gods cowered before their father. His voice thundered across.the world. Humanoids
and beasts sought to hide in the mountains and dark swamps. But the gods could not move. Bound by the will of Enigwa, they
stoad and-listened-to his judgments.
Angered beyond measure, Enigwa took Necros and flung him into the endless void. Without a single thought.of redemption,
the god of death was condemned for the murder of Enigwa’s precious daughter, Shalmar.
Turning his gaze upon his twin sons, Enigwa struck the ground, opening a great fiery, fissure that reached to the very bowels
of the world..Grabbing Grom, he tried to cast down the god of war, but Grom fought against him. Biting and clawing his father,
Grom would not submit. Enigwa’s strength surpassed that of Grom’s and he was flung into Mulkra, screaming and cursing.
Turning to Berethenu his eyes lightened. “If you would beg forgiveness I would spare you the depths of Mulkra.” But the god

of justice had committed the same acts of chaos as Grom and could not accept redemption. After Enigwa bestowed Berethenu
with the powers of life, Berethenu leapt down into the chasm and it was sealed forever.

Wis the sentencing was over, Enigwa took the remaining gods and vanished from the world. As Enigwa departed, he

set the sun and moon in orbit as a reminder of the chaos. Without!the gods, mortals were left without magic, but, the
desire to use it still existed. Over the ages, power-hungry individuals learned to harness magic through the use of certain

gems, bones, and other components. These mages were considered Pagan wizards. Learning how to mimic the powers of
Necros, Marda, Kitharu, and Dembria, these mortals gained strength and power. Without the gods’ assistance, however, they
were plagued with dangerous side-effects contained within the magic. Many wizards were destroyed by the very magic they
attempted to control.
Grom, however, found he could still grant his followers magic. From his fiery prison he continued to keep his religion alive.

Grom Warriors gathered under his banner, convinced that one day the god of war would return to them and dominate the
world. Knowing quite well that bestowing magic would keep him imprisoned forever, Berethenu also continued to support his

followers with the Gift. He believed that his people would require divine intervention to fight against the evil of Grom.

With Pagan mages, Grom Warriors, and Berethenu Knights, the lands of Juravia are still influenced by wizards and sorcery.

Monsters and beasts still roam the continents, killing those they encounter. Undead still seek to destroy life. And some sages
believe the gods still affect the lives of mortals, returning now and then to influence Juravia while Enigwa is asleep or

distracted. Although such incidents have been recorded throughout the history of mankind, they are few and far between.

A\Y

Shalmar - Goddess of Life
The most compassionate of the immortals, Shalmar was

the goddess of life. Although she did not alter man in her
image, her powers did create such creatures as the Shonrils

and Ji-Amyds. Legends say that she wept over the
bloodshed caused by her brothers and sisters, and wherever

her tears struck the ground, healing roots and medicinal

plants sprouted and blossomed. Even now, temples erected
to Shalmar exist in many regions of the world. The acolytes
and priests that populate these shrines dedicate their lives

to healing the sick and wounded. After hundreds of years,

her compassion is still evident in an otherwise chaotic and
dangerous world.

Omara - Goddess of the Harvest

Terestar - God of Time

Still worshipped by countless farmers throughout Juravia,
Omara is one of the most respected of the immortals. In
the beginning she wandered the continents teaching
mankind how to farm and harvest crops. As the Great Wars
ravaged the countryside, she remained neutral. Using her
powers she created the Sprites who she called her children.
To these wee folk Omara became both protector and
instructor, though she would not share with them the art
of her magic. Omara is still worshipped for the blessings
and wisdom that she bestowed upon mankind. Holidays
and ceremonies are held in her honor. And, although she
did not play a large role in the Great Wars, her name is yet
remembered in song.

One of the youngest gods, Terestar is the god of time. He
has complete knowledge of all past events and gains insight
through quick glimpses into the future. During the Great
Wars he used this power to counsel Berethenu and aided
the god of justice on many occasions. Although he was a
powerful figure during the early centuries, he spent his
time wandering the world in solitude. His wisdom attracted
dozens of men to his side who listened to-his words and

chronicled his visions. These writings became known as

the Scrolls of Sarmous, and they held information on future

events that would shape Juravia and the universe beyond.
sadly, many of these parchments and scrolls were lost or
destroyed over the course of time.

Galignen - God of Disease

Also known as the goddess of shadow, Dembria is the most
secretive and jealous of the immortals. Her vanity caused
her to make the moon, which has become her personal
icon. Envious of the other gods who had already altered
man, she twisted mankind into a race known as the Dunnar

created the various races, Galignen twisted man into sentient

flora. During the Great Wars Galignen unleashed pestilence

and plagues, the most severe of which was known as The
Rotting Death. These creations afflicted the mortal
multitudes and caused great suffering. Although he has
never tattght mortals his magic, Galignen did instruct his
“children” in the craft. Now, after the Banishment, the only
evidence of this god’s existence is the magic-wielding molds
and fungi.that dwell in the deepest, darkest caverns.

Necros - God of Death

The smallest, ugliest and most sinister immortal is the
god of death. In the very beginning, Necros used his

persuasiveness to provoke Grom’s competitions with

Berethenu, intensify Dembria’s jealousy toward Shalmar,
and cause tension and hostility between his other
brothers and sisters. Eventually shunned by most of
his siblings for his wretchedness, Necros isolated himself
in his secret lair. Here he instructed mortals in
Necromancy and plotted his revenge. Nothing remains
of Necros except his hidden shrine. Legends say a cult
of Necromancers, living in his temple, are working
diligently at retrieving their god from the void. These
stories and others have been used to frighten children
and travelers for ages, though no one knows if it is
truth or fiction.

Berethenu - God of Justice

Grom - God of War

Known as the Champion of Justice, Berethenu is one of
the most beloved gods. Since the beginning, he argued
for peace and tranquility. He spoke of moral codes and
equality for all races, Eventually, the armies of darkness
began their conquest of Juravia and Berethenu was
forced to raise his sword. Altering mankind into a

Massive and muscular, the god of war is the strongest
of the immortals. Grom believes in size and strength as
the only measures of greatness. Each time he altered
mankind, his humanoids became larger, stronger and
more aggressive. Grom created the Higmoni, the
Berserkers, the Ghantu, the Ogres, the Cyclops, the
Trolls, the Giants, and the Mulkrogs. Stealing Marda’s
sacred herd of golden buffalo, he twisted them into the
Minotaurs. In the end, he was cast into the fiery
underworld, imprisoned for eternity. Grom Warriors are
still awaiting the return of the god of war. Legends say
that one day Grom will escape from the abyss and return
to lead his warriors to victory. Scholars suggest this is
predicted in the Scrolls of Sarmous, but the writings

warrior-race known as the Dwarves, Berethenu used

his people to defend Juravia from the armies of Grom
and Necros. He remains a prisoner to his own morals,
trapped within the fiery underworld of Mulkra. Although
his magic is still used by his Knights to promote peace,
his most shining accomplishment is that some kingdoms
still follow the moral codes that he instilled while he
walked on Juravia. This fact alone displays the
recognition and respect the god has earned.

Player's Guide

Welcome! Forge: Out of Chaos is a fantasy role-playing game that provides an unique

experience in character design and advancement. Unlike other systems, Forge: Out of

Chaos has no class structure. This allows you, the Player, to craft your hero or heroine
however you desire.

Whether youre a role-playing veteran or a novice, you'll find Forge: Out of Chaos’: combat
system and skill advancement concepts to be simple yet realistic. The game’s magic system
is structured so that no two spell casters will ever be alike, giving the game a dimension not
found in other systems.

.

.

What is Role-playing?

Role-playing is the use of fictitious characters for entertainment in a fantasy world. Using his imagination, the Player pretends
that he is the “character” adventuring in whatever setting the Referee chooses. The decisions you make during game play will
determine the health and welfare of your character. Characters can have any personality, morals, ethics and desires you can
imagine. Although most Players’ characters typically possess the same personality as the Player, role-playing a persona that
varies dramatically from your own is often more fun. As you play the game, your character can gain experience, develop his or
her abilities, amass loads of treasure, and even die. Although losing a character to a monstrous beast is upsetting, it’s not the end
of the world. You can always create another character and start over.
Once you are ready to play, listen to the Referee relate the background for the campaign. Take notes to remember important

people with whom you should converse. Decide what actions you will take as the story unfolds. Remember that the life of your

character is in your hands. Making wise decisions is essential for a long and prosperous existence.

During the adventure you may come across various people with whom you may wish to speak. Anyone that the Referee “speaks

for” (e.g. bartender, magistrate, king) is considered a Non-Player Character (NPC), Remember that your character will hold

conversations with the NPCs. Have fun talking. You can make up accents or talk in dialects. Be creative. This is your chance
to be an actor or actress. Get into the role and enjoy yourself

You may also find that monsters, thieves or other deadly adversaries often attack your character. During these attacks, you
should refrain from chattering among yourselves because the Referee must keep careful track of the monsters, their attacks and

your actions. If everyone takes turns rolling their dice, combat will flow very smoothly. If Players start getting out of control,
it may be a long night for everyone. So remember, be kind to your Referee!

One of the most exciting parts of the adventure is cataloging your treasure. Treasure is very important! It helps you buy new
supplies, mend your damaged armor, purchase healing necessities and even buy some drinks at the tavern to celebrate your
triumphs. Although most adventuring parties find it easy to divide treasure evenly into shares (generally one per character),
some Players are greedy and selfish and want more for themselves. This can get ugly and cause Players to bicker among

So, what’s next? All the information you need to play the game is in this manual. Look over all the rules and learn them. As you

become familiar with the mechanics of the game, you will understand just how much freedom you have with character
development and advancement. Have fun and enjoy your adventures!

Player’s Checklist

You have your potato chips, ordered your pizza, the soda is chilling in the refrigerator
and you're ready to play your new fantasy role-playing system: Forge: Out ofChaos.
The only question is “how do you play?” Here is a list of everything you need to
enjoy a night of gaming. Some items are more important than others, so we ranked
them in order of necessity. Before you call your friends and set up the gaming
session, go through the checklist thoroughly and ensure you have everything you
need to play!

Game — Forge: Out of Chaos (obviously self-explanatory). Since you are reading
through this manual we can assume you have purchased the game.

Player’s Guide

People (Referee / Players) — Fantasy role-playing requires at least two people, but is most enjoyable with groups ranging

between four and six. Before you start gaming, you need to designate one person as the Referee. This can be done through a
variety of methods (e.g. choosing the person with the most creativity, letting someone volunteer, or drawing straws). The

remaining individuals become the Players. The Players create “characters”. The Referee creates the adventure! The latter is the
harder of the two positions and requires time. In order to make it easier for everyone, Basement Games Unlimited, LLC has

created adventures (also called modules). These pre-made, ready to play scenarios make it easy to sit down and start playing.

Also, the Referee Section in this rulebook will help new Referees become accustomed to the rules. We advise you take a look

at this section before you start playing.

Dice — Yes, you need dice to play. In fact, you will need special dice that include at least one of each of the following: twenty-

sided die (d20), ten-sided die (d10), eight-sided die (d8), six-sided die (d6) and four-sided die (d4). These dice can be purchased

at most hobby stores. Although it is easier if each person has his or her own set of dice, that can get costly. In order to save your
money for other necessities (i.e. pizza, soda, and potato chips), you can share one set of dice between the Players.

Supplies — Each Player needs a pen (or pencil) and something on which to record his or her character. This can be an ordinary
piece of paper or a photocopy of the character sheet located in the back of this rulebook. You will also need some graph paper
(for mapping dungeons). Graph paper can be purchased at hobby shops or at any store which carries stationery or office
supplies.

P
y not actuallyy essential, but ... Whether it’s pizza, sandwiches,
potato chips, pretzels, or even health food, it’s always nice to have something to snack on during the night. Also, don’t forget
the soda!

Clock — For those people who have early classes in the morning or must get up for work, a clock comes in very handy! It’s easy
to become distracted and lose track of time in all the excitement. Also, when angry parents or spouses (awakened by the ruckus
of the night’s adventure) come into the room and ask their favorite question “Do you know what time it is?,” you can give them
an answer!

Now that you have everything you need to start gaming, choose your Referee and start creating your characters!

Generating a Character

Each Player must generate one or more characters to participate in the game. A character is the fictitious representation of the

Player sitting at the table. This character will perform whatever action the Player desires, ifit corresponds to the gaming session

and falls within the rules of the game. To generate a character, the Player must roll dice and record the scores on paper. Forge:

Out of Chaos provides a sample character sheet at the back of this book for photocopying, though any piece of paper will do.

While the Referee is watching, each Player rolls the appropriate dice to determine characteristics. The scores determine the
overall aspects of the character (Strength, Stamina, Intellect, Insight, Dexterity, Awareness, Speed, Power and Luck). During

game play, each individual statistic will affect the character's actions, abilities and outcomes.

Sprites, on the other hand, are short and slender, making them
weaker. The higher a character’s Strength score, the more

effective he or she will be at inflicting damage with a melee
weapon and learning certain combat skills.

Stamina (STA)
Stamina measures the character’s physical endurance and

portrays the character’s life force. Stamina determines Hit
Points and defines when a character is actually dead.

Multiplying the character's Stamina score by 2 calculates Hit

Points (rounding down to a whole number). For example, a
character with a Stamina score of 7.7 has 15 Hit Points.
Whenever the character absorbs damage, Hit Points are

deducted from the current score. Ifa character falls to exactly
0, unconsciousness occurs for 3 minutes before awaking with

Rolling Characteristics
Nine characteristics define the characters in the Forge: Out of

Chaos role-playing system. Rolling 2d6 and 1d10 generates

the first six (Strength, Stamina, Intellect, Insight, Dexterity,

and Awareness). To determine the characteristic score, add
the d6s to calculate the whole number and add the d10 result
to that score to find the percentile value. If a Player rolls a
zero on the d10, count it as a full point. For example, Paul

rolls 2d6 with a combined score of9 (the whole number). He
then rolls a d10 with a result of 3 (the percentile). The roral
unmodified score for the characteristic is 9.3. These

characteristic scores may be arranged however the Player

wishes. It is imperative when generating a character to keep
future goals in mind (e.g. if you want to play a big, hulking
brute ofa warrior, don’t place a 3.4 in Strength!).

The last three characteristics (Speed, Power, and Luck) are

1 Hit Point. During this time, the character lies is in a prone
position and is unable to defend himself. This results in all
attacks being made against his DV2.
If knocked to negative Hit Points, the character continues to

lose 1 Hit Point per minute until healed. This is a result of
blood loss suffered because the character’s wounds are too
serious to heal by themselves. When a character reaches the
negative Hit Point equivalent to his Stamina score, the
character is dead. In the above example, a character with a

Stamina score of 7.7 would be irrevocably dead once reaching

Intellect (INT)

Intellect measures a character’s intelligence. When added to

objects; however characters with an exceptional Awareness

score are more likely to succeed.

Selecting a Race

Each race in the Forge: Out of Chaos system has distinct
benefits and detriments that can affect skills, characteristics

and Saving Throws. Some races gain heightened sight and
natural protection, while others are misshapen or suffer
negative characteristic modifiers. Each race has its own unique
qualities and is fluent in its own language (Dwarf, EIf, etc.) as
well as the Juravian language. This allows all the races the
ability to speak with each other.

Player’s Guide

Berserkers
Berserkers are aggressive warriors that are larger than

man-sized and weigh more than 300 pounds. They possess

average builds, which gives them a maximum Strength
potential of 13.0. Berserkers have extended foreheads, ridged

with a layer of leathery skin. Their eyes are piercing and usually
range from light green to brown in color. They have red or
brown hair that is grown long and kept in braids. Having
Normal Vision that reaches a range of 60’, this race is unable

to see at night or in darkness. Berserkers have a life expectancy
of 60 years.

Berserkers are exceptionally strong and hearty, gaining a +1.0

to both their Strength and Stamina scores. Born and raised for
combat, Berserkers gain an automatic +1 to their Attack Value
which increases their ability to hit with any weapon they wield.

This benefit does not disqualify the Berserker from credits
toward skill advancement. Furthermore, they are raised to be
fearless in combat and gain a +4 to Saving Throw vs. Fear.

Although they are fantastic warriors, they are not as agile or
observant as the other races and must subtract -1.0 from both

their Dexterity and Awareness statistics. Also, they are unusually

susceptible to Disease and Magic and receive a -4 Saving Throw

penalty against each.

The Berserkers’ love of combat is equaled only by their Fear of
Magic. Because of this, they are unable to learn magic of any
type and are prohibited from using magic items or
enchantments. Their Fear of Magic is so intense that not even
beneficial applications of it may be used on them without
provoking a violent reaction.
This race can often be found living in tribes ruled by a single
leader. The chieftain is the most powerful warrior in the clan
and must continue to show superiority through trials of strength

and courage. His word is considered law in the tribe. Any
Berserker that ignores the chieftain’s commands is driven from
the community.

Dunnar
Dunnar are the children of Dembria, goddess of enchantment.

They are typically man-sized, averaging a height of 5’ with
slender builds. This limits their Strength score to a maximum
of 9.0. Their bodies are exceptionally thin and their skin is

pale white. From a distance they appear almost undead with

long, thin fingers and tufts of gray hair growing about their

bodies. Dunnar have Night Vision that allows their eyes to
amplify light. This benefit enables them to see up to 60’,

regardless of the illumination source. When outdoors at night
the Dunnar can see clearly because of the light given by the
moon, though in the absence of light (underground, etc.) they

benefit enjoyed by this race is the ability to Detect Magic by
touch. This helps Dunnar find enchanted items. Though they

AS

can detect the existence of magic, the ability does not allow
them to determine the item’s attributes. Dunnar are
Photosensitive and suffer damage when exposed to sunlight.
This detriment inflicts 1 point of actual damage for each hour

the character is exposed. In addition, they suffer a -4 Saving
Throw penalty against attacks dealing with Death. Lastly, the

lower body of this race is Misshapen, resulting in the lowering

of the Speed score by -1.

Because this race has no region to call its own, they are usually
found wandering about the world in small nomadic bands.

Like gypsies, Dunnar are shunned and stereotyped as criminals

and rogues. Humanoid communities ostracize the Dunnar and

blame them for any trouble that occurs when they are present.

Although unfair and most often unjust, this persecution is very
common and forces the Dunnar to continually move about.

Dwarves
Dwarves are a race of humanoids that are smaller than man-sized,
standing only 4' tall. They possess wide shoulders and strong backs.
Easily distinguished from other races, they have long beards, which
are dark in color; their eyes are gray or black. They possess Heat Vision
with a range of 30". This type of vision enables Dwarves to see in
complete darkness. By viewing various shades of temperature, the race

can distinguish objects (doors, walls, monsters, etc.) without the benefit
of a light source. When a light source is present (lantern, torch, or
even the moon), the sight range is reduced to 1/3 its distance. Their

short stature and stocky build result in a maximum Strength potential
of 11.5. This race has a life expectancy of 120 years, though some
have surpassed 150.
Their compact frames give Dwarves the benefit of being very Sturdy.
Though smaller than man-sized, Dwarven characters may use medium

weapons in one hand and still employ a shield in defense. They can
also use large weapons such as the mattock and spear. These weapons

require two hands and prohibit the use of a shield. Due to their
militaristic nature, Dwarves have developed specialized weaponry to
use against their enemies. These weapons include the battle axe

and war hammer. In addition to being Sturdy, dwarves are a hearty
race as well. This gives them a +4 Saving Throw vs. Poison and Disease.
Dwarves receive a-1.0 modifier to their Awareness score. Furthermore,

the race suffers a -4 Saving Throw when forced to save against Death
and Magic.

Dwarves are the children of Berethenu, god of honorable combat.

‘They maintain a strong sense of loyalty and honor. Their societies are

broken down into clans, each consisting of several dozen familics. Each
clan includes a clan chieftain who owes allegiance to regional lords or
monarchs. Dwarves are hardened warriors by nature and follow their
strict command structures without fail. During the Banishment and

in the ages that followed, they fought great territorial battles with armies

of the Higmoni. These wars have created a great animosity between
the two races.
Dwarves prefer to live underground in vast cities carved from stone.

When found wandering above ground they are most often
youngsters roaming about on adventurers, merchants moving

goods between clans or regions, or mature warriors performing
quests for their king.

Elves
Elves are a race of humanoids that are man-sized in height and

possess slender builds. Their thin body structure results in a

maximum Strength potential of 9.0. Elves stand approximately
5' tall and typically weigh less than 140 pounds. Their hair is

usually of a light color. Their eyes are usually greenish-blue.

Elves possess Normal Vision that extends to a maximum range
of 60', Their average life expectancy is 140 years.

Elves are exceptionally gifted in the art of magic, enjoying a
+25% bonus to the Magic skill base, regardless of the sphere
studied. In addition, Elves are very personable. Because of this,

they gain a +25% modifier to their Reaction Rolls when dealing
with NPCs. They also gain an increased Saving Throw vs. Mind
attacks equal to +4. Although Elves are exceptional wizards,

they are susceptible to certain harmful attacks, receiving a -4

Saving Throw against Disease and Fear. Another Elven
detriment is the limitation of Slow Healing, Instead of healing

1 Hit Point every night, elves heal only 1 Hit Point for every
24 hours of continuous rest.
Elves reside in any region. Their societies are governed by a
council of women, the oldest and wisest in the area. Eager to
live comfortable and productive lives, Elves avoid combat and
aggressive actions. They seek to use their intelligence and
wisdom rather than their strength to solve problems. Although
they are non-aggressive, Elves will fight to preserve their lives.
They have developed weapons such as the spear and long bow,
though some use bladed melee weapons as well.

Ghantu
Ghantu are the children of Grom, though these humanoids
are far more animalistic and aggressive than their maker’s
previous creation, the Berserkers. Ghantu stand more than 7’
in height and weigh more than 400 pounds. Their height and

stocky builds allow them to reach a maximum Strength score

of 15.5, making them the strongest of the humanoid races.
This allows the Ghantu to inflict severe damage with their
weapons. Their faces and stature resemble gorillas; they are
covered with dark brown or black hair. Ghantu possess a

single eye. Monocular vision limits the race’s depth
perception, resulting in a -3 Attack Value when using
missile weapons. They favor such melee weapons
as the maul and two-handed sword, which they

developed to use against their enemies. The thick

hides and fur that covers their bodies grant them
a natural Armor Rating of 1, making them harder

to hit in combat situations. Nocturnal by nature, Ghantu
possess Night Vision that extends to a range of 60'. This type
of sight amplifies light and allows the race to see clearly up to
its maximum sight distance regardless of the illumination

source. Although completely blind in actual darkness, a lantern,
torch or even the moon sheds enough light for them to see.

Ghantu have a life span of only 50 years.

Besides their thick hides, Ghantu are exceptionally strong and

gain a +2.0 to their Strength score. Their hands are large, with

Yee ise

wide, flat fingers and dangerous claws. When in combat they
can use these claws as weapons, attacking once per combat
minute. The damage inflicted is equal to 1d4 and is modified
by their Strength scores. To determine their Attack Value, add
the Ghantu’s Brawling skill level (if applicable) to any

vei CTT

appropriate Dexterity modifiers.

Although Grom granted them immense size and Strength

potential, he cursed them with a learning disability. This

detriment forces the race to expend double the standard
number of skill slots necessary to learn a skill. This
effectively cuts their skill potential in half! Since Divine

Magic is granted by the gods, this detriment does not
apply when learning Berethenu or Grom Magic.
Lastly, Ghantu are weak-minded and suffer a -4
Saving Throw penalty to all Mind attacks.

This race is tribal and lives in mountainous terrain
or hilly regions. They are territorial by nature
and defend their borders with great ferocity.

Their tribal leaders are strong and imposing,

commanding great respect. An

extremely powerful leader will

unite several tribes in order to
plunder other civilizations. Most
races hate and fear the Ghantu
due to their warlike nature.

Higmoni
Unlike Grom’s other children, Higmoni are only man sized,

standing 5' tall. Disappointed by their stunted height and
strength, Grom created other races that would better emulate

his beliefs and ideals, ignoring the Higmoni entirely. Although

not as tall as the Berserkers and Ghantu, Higmoni possess

stocky builds that allow them a maximum Strength potential
of 13.5. Their facial features are distinctly boar-like with

extended jaws and large tusks. Their eyes are small and black;
their skin is leathery and brown. Higmoni possess Heat Vision

with a maximum range of 60’. This type of sight allows them
to see the heat radiating from objects and living creatures. Since
everything gives off a thermal signature, Higmoni are able to
see objects (furniture, walls, doors, monsters, etc.), even in
complete darkness. However, ifa light source is present (torch,
lantern, even the moon), their vision is reduced to 1/3 its

normal range. The average life span of a Higmoni is 40 years.

Although strong, Higmoni are not as agile as other races and
receive a-1.0 to their Dexterity scores. They suffer a -4 Saving
Throw against Disease and Mind. In addition, Grom cursed
the Higmoni with glands that constantly secret a noxious Odor,

lowering their reaction rolls with other races by -30%. This

offensive scent also causes them to receive a -10% from their
Hiding skill base. Although Grom cursed the Higmoni with
detriments, he granted them incredible regenerative powers,
accelerating their healing ability to 2 Hit Points per night rather
than the normal 1.

Higmoni are aggressive and warlike by nature. They have
developed the boar spear to use against the mounted cavalry

of the humans and the bastard sword to hack through Dwarven
armor. Higmoni live in mountainous regions and desolate
wastelands. They are savage and brutal, pillaging nearby

settlements and kingdoms to gain treasure and resources. They

have had brutal wars with the Dwarves, creating a long-standing
animosity. Higmoni live in tribal communities and exist under
a single leader called a warrior king. The king retains power
and title through a ceremony called the Shigenruk (Battle of
Blood) when potential leaders battle to the death for control
of the tribe. These ceremonial battles result in frequent changes
of leadership, usually followed by a plundering campaign led

by the triumphant warrior king.

Humans
Humans are the most populous of all the races. They were the
first race created by Enigwa and the gods. Although commonly
held to be pure of heart and spirit, Humans possess a wide
variety of emotional, ethical, and spiritual attitudes.
Humans vary widely in appearance. Most stand nearly 6’ tall.
They possess an average build granting them a Strength
potential of 11.0. Their hair, eye and skin color can vary
dramatically. They possess Normal Vision with a range of 60,
but are unable to see in the dark.
Humans do not possess any natural benefits or detriments.

Because they are the most populous race, their kingdoms cover

most of the world and its regions. Through the ages, Humans
have been involved in countless wars and skirmishes. They
often battle their own race (and other races) for glory, wealth
and territory. To gain advantages in war, they were the first to

use horses in combat. Humans have developed many weapons

such as the crossbow, mace, morning star, and lance.

Jher-ems stand only 3' tall and weigh less than 90 pounds.
They are smaller than man-sized and possess average builds,

resulting in a Strength potential limited to 9.0. Their faces
and bodies resemble shrews having long, extended noses and
jaws, short brown hair that covers their bodies, and small beady

eyes. Although their eyesight grants them Normal vision with

a range of only 30’, this race possesses a keen olfactory sense.
This heightened sense of smell grants the race an innate tracking
ability with a 25% chance of success. Unless the character learns
the Tracking skill, this capability will never improve. If the
Jher-em character learns the Tracking skill, this bonus will be
added to his skill base. The race’s exceptionally high metabolic
rate reduces its life span to only 30 years.
Beside their Heightened Olfactory sense, Jher-em possess long

points of damage. This form of attack does not prohibit the

Jher-em from performing other actions during the same combat

minute; however, the tail attack may only be used against

opponents attacking the Jher-em’s DV2. Jher-ems also possess
the strange power of Telepathy (at a maximum range of 30’).
This allows them to speak with any humanoid race. Although
capable of reading the surface thoughts of a target creature

and conveying simple messages, Jher-ems are unable to delve
into the subject’s memory or discern otherwise hidden
intentions. To use Telepathy, the Jher-em must concentrate

on the target creature. During this time, the Jher-em is
prohibited from performing any other actions. Note that
creatures with Mind Protection (Dunnar, Limrises, etc.) are
immune to such telepathic communication.
Although this race can perform any normal action, these
creatures are Misshapen, having hunched backs and/or
shortened arms. This detriment affects their combat abilities,
causing them to suffer a -1 Attack Value. In addition, they
have a respiratory ailment that prohibits them from excessive
running.

This race lives in large communities, typically on open plains.
Their leaders are called Magaruun, and they are both spiritual
advisors and shamans. Jher-ems are a peaceful race; they abhor
violence and bloodshed. Throughout the Great Wars they
remained neutral and uninvolved. Even now, they avoid using
weapons of any kind and rarely wander far from their
homelands. Due to their passive nature, other races have
invaded their lands and plundered their goods and resources
over the ages.

Kithsara
This race is the creation of Kitharu, god of the elemental forces
of nature. They are man-sized in height, standing roughly
5' 6" tall and weighing about 150 pounds. Their stature and
average builds limit their maximum Strength potential to 11.0.
These creatures are lizard-like in many ways. Dull, green Scales
cover their bodies, providing them a natural Armor Rating of

can be used as weapons. When biting an opponent in melee
combat, the Kithsara has a natural Attack Value of 3. A
successful hit inflicts 1d3 points of damage, regardless of the
creature's Strength. When employing this attack, the Kithsara

is unable to perform any other action. Their eyes are narrow
and their pupils are split vertically, having a dark red or orange

color. They have Normal Vision with a range of 60’. Like
lizards, these creatures have forked tongues. They have a typical
life span of 70 years.

Kithsara are innately magical. This advantage grants them a
+3 to their Power score, making them formidable magic-users.

Although they possess potent magical talents, they are less

immune to certain harmful attacks and receive a -4 modifier
when forced to make Saving Throws against Poison and Death.
Kithsara also possess the detriment of Thin Blood. This
detriment causes them to lose 2 Hit Points per minute when
reduced to negative Hit Points rather than the normal 1. The
Kithsara also receive a -1.0 to their Stamina score.
This race prefers to dwell in solitude, building their small
communities in caves or marshes. They elect a leader or elder

who governs the group. The leader is often the oldest, and
presumably wisest, member of the community. Groups of
elders, sharing common areas, often gather to discuss
improvements and treaties.

Merikii
Merikii are the children of Marda, goddess of beasts. Although

they are humanoid, their facial features are distinctly birdlike
with long, pointed beaks and wide, clear eyes. Their bodies
are covered with tiny golden or silver feathers. They have an
average life span of 50 years, though some have lived as long as

70. Merikii possess Night Vision that allows them to amplify
light and see up to a distance of 90". Although capable of seeing
far distances with a minor light source (torch, lantern, or
moonlight), they are completely blind in the absence of one.
This being true Merikii, like humans, require a light source
when traveling underground. Merikii are man-sized in stature.
They have slender builds, limiting their Strength potential to

9.0. They stand roughly 5’ 2" and weigh about 100 pounds.
These creatures are typically thin and wiry. Their quick reflexes

and agility allow them to attack with both hands in a single

combat minute. This automatically grants them the equivalent

of the Two Handed Melee skill. Although able to attack twice
per minute, Merikii may only use small weapons such as clubs,
daggers, hammers, hand axes, knives, long knives, scimitars,

and short swords.

Although they are proficient warriors, Merikii are weaker than
most races and suffer a -1.0 to their Strength score. They are

also cursed with Thin Blood. This detriment causes them to
lose 2 Hit Points per minute when they are forced into negative
Hit Points rather than the normal 1. Finally, they suffer a -4
Saving Throw against Mind attacks.

Merikii are territorial and aggressive. They developed weaponry
such as the long knife and scimitar to compliment their natural
ambidextrous ability. They live in densely wooded areas and
have a genuine love for nature and animals.

Sprites

Sprites are the children of Omara, goddess of the harvest. They
are small in stature, reaching a height of only 3' and typically

weighing less than 70 pounds. Smaller than man and having

slender builds, Sprites can reach a maximum Strength of only
7.0. Although they have a similar appearance to Humans, this
race has pointed ears and very thin faces. Their hair ranges
from blond to sandy brown and their eyes are brown or
greenish-blue. Sprites have Normal vision that extends to 60'.
They are a short-lived race, having a life span of only 80 years.
Altered by the goddess of the harvest, Sprites have a natural
resistance to Disease and gain a +4 modifier to their Saving

Throw. Their bodies are frail and weak, however, causing them
to suffer a -1.0 to their Strength score. In addition, Sprites are

timid by nature and suffer a -4 to their Saving Throws vs.
Fear.

The most important blessing that Omara bestowed on this
race is the ability to sense the emotional states of humanoids
around them. This form of Empathy reaches a distance of 30'

and requires concentration on a particular creature. The ability
is so keen that Sprites can detect such emotions as friendship,

deceit, anger, hatred, compassion, and envy. This natural ability

SSN

makes it almost impossible for Sprites to be deceived or tricked!

Sprites are passive creatures. Seldom do they wander far from

their homelands or partake in adventure. However, they enjoy

hearing tales of exploration. They elect several regents to rule
over their communities, which are typically found in grassy
hills or plains. Alchough they dislike violence, Sprites will fight
to defend themselves and their homes. Forced to use small

weapons because of their size, they have developed the sling to
use as a missile weapon and use daggers and hand axes in melee
combat. Although most of the race fears adventure, some

Sprites are born with a desire to travel. These Sprites, considered

eccentric by their own race, leave their towns and villages to
wander about in small groups. Even though these adventurous

Sprites are far more aggressive than the race in general, they
often maintain their peaceful and friendly dispositions.

Character Height

The height of a character determines the types of weapons
that may be used in combat situations. Smaller characters
cannot use two-handed weapons. Giant creatures find daggers
and knives too small to wield properly. In addition, height
affects the cost and availability of armor.
Smaller than Man - between three and five feet. The major

detriment is that wee folk cannot wield two-handed weapons

and medium weapons require two hands for them to use. Since
armor requires less material to manufacture, the price is
reduced by 25%. The races included in this size category are

Dwarves, Jher-ems, and Sprites.

Average Build - Depending on the height of the character,
damage potential can be adequate. A smaller than man-sized
creature with an average build has a maximum damage
potential of +1. A man-sized individual with an average build
reaches his maximum damage potential at +2. Larger than

man-sized character has a potential of +3 damage.

Stocky Build—A stocky build reflects wide shoulders and strong
muscular frames. A stocky individual that is smaller than mansized can inflict a maximum of +2 damage. A stocky, mansized person can reach a potential of +3 damage. Ghantu,
being stocky and larger that man-sized, illustrate the maximum
benefit, reaching a maximum Strength potential of 15.5,

allowing them to inflict up to +4 damage.

Man-sized - between five and seven feet. Man-sized creatures
receive no positive or negative modifiers because of their height.
The category includes Dunnar, Elves, Higmoni, Humans,
Kithsara, and Mertkii.

Larger than Man - more than seven feet. Characters of this
height are prohibited from using small weapons, may not ride
steeds (eliminating all Horsemanship and Mounted Combat
skills), and pay 50% more for armor due to material costs.
On the positive side, they handle large weapons (e.g. two-

handed swords and mauls) with ease. This allows them to
attack once per combat minute regardless of the weapon type.

In addition, they are able to use the Parrying and Final Blow

skills with large weapons. The only races included in this
category are Berserkers and Ghantu.

Character Builds
Slender Build - Slender builds mean narrow shoulders and a
less muscular physique, resulting in a weaker Strength
characteristic and a lower damage potential. Characters who
are slender and smaller than man-sized cannot achieve an
exceptional Strength score. A character that is slender and mansized reaches a plateau of +1, while characters that are slender

and larger than man-sized reach a maximum damage potential
of +2.

Altering the Races

Once a race is selected, a Player may choose from a list of
benefits and detriments to alter the character. These alterations
will not change the character's overall appearance, nor will
they affect the general qualities of the character's race. They
serve only to enable the Player to create a unique character.
Each benefit has a positive value associated with it. A Player
can choose up to three benefits, despite the total positive value
rating. After the benefits are chosen, the Player is then obligated

to choose detrimental aspects to counter the bonuses. These
detriments have a negative value associated with them. ‘The
Player must choose a number of side effects that will reduce
the character’s positive score to zero. Note that this could result
in the character having in excess of three detriments.
Following is a list of the benefits that may be chosen and the
positive values associated with each. The table of detriments

is included on the following page.

Saving Throws
A Saving Throw is a character's chance of negating or reducing
certain harmful effects including: Death, Disease, Fear, Magic,

Mind and Poison. To calculate a Player’s base Saving Throw,
subtract the Luck characteristic score from 20.

Player’s Guide

Hit Points

Hit points represent the amount of damage that a creature
may sustain before falling unconscious. For Players,

multiplying the Stamina score by two determines their
character’s Hit Points (rounding down). Once calculated, this
number becomes the character's maximum Hit Point value.
He is unable to surpass this value without magical assistance.
When a character takes actual damage (damage not absorbed

by armor, shield, or other protective devices), damage is

deducted from Hit Points. When the character sustains enough
damage to reduce his Hit Points to zero, the character falls
unconscious. While in this state the character is unable to

perform any action and is completely defenseless. Any attack

aimed at an unconscious creature affects its DV2. The character
remains unconscious for three full minutes. He then awakens
with 1 Hit Point and may resume activity.
If a creature inflicts enough damage to reduce the character to
negative Hit Points, the character falls unconscious and
continues to lose Hit Points at a rate of one per minute.
Nothing can prevent this Hit Point loss short of healing
(whether normal or magical). When a character reaches the
negative number equal to his Stamina score, he is dead.
For example, a warrior has a 10.7 Stamina (21 Hit Points).

He tangles with a hungry beastie and is dropped to -6 Hit

Points. If the monster does not rend the character, he will lose
1 Hit Point per minute until he reaches -10, when he will die.

Skills are what define the character. Some Players may wish to

learn all combat skills, while others seek more stealthy
proficiencies. As the Player, the decision is yours. Mix and

match, if you like. You have complete control over the skills
your character learns. The only stipulation is that you should
ask the Referee how many skills you may start with and what
types of proficiencies are allowed. Sometimes the Referee might
prohibit some skills at the beginning of the game depending
on the his or her scenario. Keep in mind, the character may
learn new skills during game play if skill slots remain.
One of the best things about the Forge: Out ofChaos system is
that skills increase individually with use. Remember this: each

time your character successfully uses a skill, the character

receives a credit toward advancement. When the adventure is

over these credits may turn into percentage points and your

character may gain levels of experience. In no time, you may
find yourself to be the greatest swordsman in the world! But,

you'll never get there if you don’t record your “credits.”

Learning Skills
When Players are generating characters, they should ask the
Referee certain questions. First, they should ask for the list of
skills their characters are permitted to learn. Referees may opt
to limit this list in certain situations or may allow the Players
to choose any skill. Once the types of skills are outlined, the

Players should then ask how many skill slots their characters
receive. This enables them to pick the skills they want to learn.

Skills

Although it is easier to start with a high number of skills,

In Forge, a specific profession does not define a character.

of the character’s life. To learn a skill, a character must either
attend a University or seek out a free-lance teacher or instructor

Instead, each Player is able to choose from an unrestricted list
of skills. This allows the Player to craft the ideal character. If
you want to be an axe wielding, lock picking, spell casting
wizard, just choose the skills and write them down. Although
there are no rule limitations to the types of skills you can
learn, it is left to the Referee’s discretion as to the number and

type of skills that are available at the beginning of the game.

Sometimes it is more enjoyable to start with fewer skills,
allowing Players the opportunity to craft their characters as

the game unfolds. Other times it is easier to let Players choose
all of cheir characters’ skills prior to starting the campaign.

When choosing a skill, be sure to consider your character's
strengths and weaknesses. For example, a character with a low

Dexterity will not be very good at a skill that requires good

hand-eye coordination (e.g. Disarm Traps). Likewise, a

character with a low Power score may not make an effective

wizard. Since characteristics directly affect skill bases, look

carefully at your characteristics before you choose your skills.

Once a race is chosen, the Player must decide which skills to
learn. Each character starts with a certain number of “skill
slots” determined by his or her character’s statistics. As
characters learn skills, skill slots are expended. When no slots

remain, the character has reached his maximum learning

capacity and may not learn any more skills without magical
assistance.

sometimes it is more enjoyable to learn skills during the course

who will teach a particular proficiency in exchange for payment

(Remember, in order to teach a skill a person must have the
Instruction skill). Learning a skill requires one consecutive
month of training per skill slot. Thus, to learn Parrying (a
skill requiring two skill slots) would take two consecutive
months.
Although learning skills in the middle of a quest might not be
possible, between adventures there is usually a short break

(everyone has to spend their hard-earned money drinking ales,

throwing parties and celebrating their success). During this

time characters can learn new skills, providing a suitable teacher
can be found. The general cost (which will vary based upon

the discretion of the Referee) ranges between 30 and 50 gold
coins per skill slot. Although Universities are not known for
haggling, private teachers have been known to negotiate
payment on occasion. Keep in mind that certain skills are
considered illegal or unethical. These skills (like Assassination,

Missile) may be far more expensive to learn, or it may be
impossible to find someone to teach them. Skill availability is
left to the Referee’s discretion.

Basic skills

is used successfully but there was nothing to gain from the

Basic skills (e.g. Language, Singing, and Sleight of Hand) do
not have standard skill bases and do not increase through

individual use. They exist primarily for character development.

Although some have chances of success based on
characteristics, these chances never increase.

Percentage Skills

Percentage Skills have a skill base ranging between 1-100%,
which is calculated from the character's stats. Every time a
character successfully uses a skill, he gains a credit toward
advancement in that particular proficiency. You must keep
careful track of how often you succeed in using each Percentage
Skill. You can do this by either placing a mark by the skill on
your character sheet or keeping track on a sheet of paper.
When an adventure is over (or at the discretion of the Referee),

a Player can determine if his character advanced in any of his
skills. To do this, roll 1d100 for each credit toward skill
advancement you recorded in a percentage skill.
If the result of the dice is lower than the current skill percentage,
the character does not advance. Erase the credit from your

sheet and continue rolling until you have no more credits

remaining. For example, a character with the Tracking skill
has a 54% base. During his last adventure he successfully used
the skill three times, earning three credits toward Tracking skill
advancement. Waiting for the Referee’s permission, he rolls
his percentage dice (1d100). The first score was a 12%. It is
lower than his base (54%) so he does not advance. He now
has two credits left. His second roll is 53%. This is still lower

than his base. He does not modify his Tracking skill, and he
has just one credit left. With a frustrated expression, he tosses

success (e.g. successfully finding a trap that wasn’t there or
using the Tracking skill when there is nothing to see). In either
of these cases, do not record the credit on the character’s
records.

Leveled Skills

Leveled skills are similar to Percentage Skills in that they have
a skill base that extends from 1-100%, determined by the
character's statistics. Likewise, a character gains credit toward
skill advancement with each successful use of the skill. At the
end of an adventure (or at the Referee’s discretion), a character
has the chance to increase his skill base in one or more of his
Leveled Skills. Although the structure for gaining advancement
credits is the same, the difference between Percentage Skills
and Leveled Skills is the method for advancing.
Unlike Percentage Skills which require a 1d100 roll higher
than the character’s skill base, Leveled Skills require a 1d100
score equal to or below the character's base to qualify for an
increase. Consider a warrior with Mattock skill. The warrior is
Ist level in the weapon with a 54% base. During an adventure

he successfully hits with the weapon three times. This qualifies
him for three credits toward advancement. Rolling the 14100,

the Player scores a 97%. His first attempt ended in failure

since the score was higher than the character's skill base. The
character now has only two credits remaining. The next roll
scores a 12%. Success! His skill base is increased to 55% and
he has one attempt remaining. Throwing the percentile dice,
he rolls a 55%. Another success! Since the score is equal to his
current skill base, the warrior gains another 1%. His new base
is 56%. He is now out of attempts and must wait for a new
adventure to gain more “credits”,

the dice one last time and scores a 77%. He succeeds in
advancing!

Although Players may find it difficult to advance at the

percentage, the character gains additional knowledge of the

proficiency. This increases his skill base by +1%. (In the above
example the Tracking skill base would increase to 55%). In

order to advance the d100 roll must be equal to or higher
than 55%. Since the character has no more credits remaining,
he will have to go on another adventure before he rolls again.
You will soon learn two interesting points. First, although it is

harder to successfully use a Percentage Skill and gain credits

at the beginning (because the skill bases are so low), it is easier

to advance. As you attain higher skill bases, it becomes easier

to successfully use the Percentage Skill (and gain credits),
though it will be harder to advance. Once a character reaches
100% in a skill, no further increase is possible. This reflects
the character's mastery of that particular skill.

There are two exceptions to this rule. Both disqualify the

character from gaining credit toward advancement. The first

restriction states that, if a character receives any positive

modifier to a skill attempt due to Referee discretion, magical
intervention or random occurrence, no credit toward
advancement will be earned. This is because the character had
help in performing the skill. The second exception is if a skill

beginning (when the skill base is low), it will become much
easier over time. In fact, when a character’s skill base reaches

100% is attained, the character's skill level increases by 1 and
he gains all the benefits of this new level (i.e. higher Attack

Values, more spells, etc.). The Player must then recalculate
his character’s skill base, subtracting 4%. This penalty is
cumulative per level. Eventually the character's skill base will
be 0%, and no more advancement will be possible.
For example, the same character trained in Mattock starts at

level 1 with a base percentage of 54%. Through many
successful battles, he hits 75 times with the weapon, gaining
75 “credits” toward advancement. After the adventure, the
Player rolls his 1d100 to determine advancement. He succeeds

46 times, working his skill base up to 100%. The character

attains 2nd level! He gains +1 AV but his skill base is reduced
to 50% (54%-4%=50%). On reaching 3rd level, his AV would
increase again but his new skill base would be 46%.

It must be noted that if a character receives any increase to a
skill attempt because of Referee discretion, magical
intervention or random occurrence, it will disqualify him from
receiving credit towards skill advancement. In this case, the
Player should not record a “credit” on his character’s records.

Learning Magic
Magic is the use of supernatural powers to manipulate the
environment around your character. If you choose Magic as a
skill, you must then select the type of magic your character
will learn. There are six spheres available, each possessing its
own unique power. For a breakdown of each sphere, turn to
the Magic Section.

Basic SKILLS

SKILL SLOTS

Characters that learn magic must decide which spells they
will learn, and how many Spell Points (SPTS) they have. They

must also purchase any components they will need. Forge:

Out of Chaos describes all of this information in great detail in
the Magic Section of this rulebook. The important thing to
remember is that some Mages (Wizards or Spell Casters)

require the use of physical objects that help in the casting of
spells. Without these items they cannot manipulate Magic.
In other words, make sure you buy the necessary components.

Basic Skills

Field Repair

Armory
Armory is a more advanced form of the Field Repair skill. When
learned, the character can restore any type of damage inflicted
to armor or metal shields whether by sword, acid or spell.
Unlike the lesser proficiency, an armorer does not require a
field repair case to reconstruct armor but does, however, require
a forge. This makes it impossible to utilize the Armory skill
while on the road. The skill automatically restores the armor,

providing the appropriate type and number of repair kits or

materials are on hand. Because of the labor required to mend
armor, it takes five minutes to repair each point of damage.
Shields require one ring mail repair kit per point mended.

Binding

Characters proficient in Binding can administer healing to
wounded creatures by using binding kits. With each kit used,
the character automatically restores 3 Hit Points to the target
creature. Binding only cures damage inflicted by weapons (e.g.
swords, claws, or teeth), and will not heal damage inflicted by
poisons, spores, spells, or other means. The skill requires one
minute to perform. Note that without binding kits, this skill
offers no benefit.

Exceptional Strength

This skill increases the character’s Strength by 1.0 point. The
increase affects the character's damage potential as well as
certain skill bases.

appropriate armor type. When using the skill the character
automatically repairs one point of damage for every two
minutes worth of labor. Although the skill can be used to

repair damage inflicted by weapons (e.g. swords, claws, and
teeth) the character is incapable of repairing damage inflicted

by acids. Note that without the field repair case or the

appropriate repair kits, this skill offers no benefit. Each repair
uses one repair kit.

Heraldry

A character studying Heraldry must concentrate on a particular
humanoid empire. Once chosen, the character is familiar with
the culture of that kingdom. This grants the character the

ability to identify standards or symbols of various factions

and armies within that particular culture. For example, a

character fluent in the Heraldry of Hampton could view battle
standards and identify the various armies of that kingdom.
Once the Heraldry skill is learned, a character may opt to study
Heraldry for additional kingdoms. This does not require
another skill slot but does require two months of study. There
is no limit to the number of cultures a character can learn.

History
History grants the character knowledge of record concerning

Exceptional Stamina
When this skill is learned, it raises the Stamina characteristic

by 1.0 point. This affects the character’s Hit Points.

Exceptional Intellect
This skill adds 1.0 point to the character's Intellect score. The
increase attects the character's spell attempts per level, the
number of skill slots he can learn, and several skill bases.

Exceptional Insight

a specific region. It gives names of terrain, structures, places,

and people. This information may be beneficial during the
course of an adventure, providing the characters are traveling
through a studied area. Once the History skill is studied for

one region, it can be learned for multiple regions without
expending additional skill slots. The cost, however, is two

months of research per History the character wishes to study.

Horsemanship

Learning this skill increases the character's Insight characteristic
by 1.0 point. Increasing this statistic affects the maximum
spell level a character can attain and the number of skill slots
available.

Horsemanship allows a character to ride, maneuver, and control
a horse or other steed. Once learned, a character can attack
while mounted without fear of falling. The character suffers a

speed value by one point for up to 30 minutes.

Hunting
Hunting comes in handy when traveling in the wilderness.

Por every six hours spent hunting, the character has a 50%
chance of finding food. The amount of sustenance that is found

can support one person for 2-5 (1d4+1) days. Although very
helpful if someone is starving, the character cannot travel very
far when hunting. His traveling distance is reduced to 1/4

the normal rate. The Referee can modify the base chance of
success depending on the terrain.

Juggling

Instruction
Learning the Instruction skill enables a character to teach his
proficiencies to other people. The skill requires at Jeast a 9.0
Insight to master and without the appropriate statistic, the
skill offers no benefit. It is common for instructors to charge
between 30 to 50 gold coins per skill slot for their services.
Multiple students may be taught as follows:

Up to five students when teaching a skill requiring one skill
slot (e.g. Field Repair and Weapon Skill)

Up to two students when teaching a skill requiring two skill
slots (e.g. Binding)
Only one student when teaching a skill requiring three or
more skill slots (e.g. Beast Magic)
Although the Instruction skill can be used to teach Pagan Magic,
it cannot teach Divine Magic (Berethenu Magic and Grom

Magic). Only the gods can grant this knowledge!
Instrument

Learning this skill, a character masters a single musical
instrument. This instcument must be a drum, flute, lyre, or

mandolin. The Player must specify which instrument his

character will learn. With the ability to play the instrument
with great skill also comes the ability to read and write music
for the instrument.

(

The character gains the ability to juggle one small object (e.g.

ball, knife or torch) for every 2.0 points of Dexterity he

possesses (rounded down). Each minute the character spends
juggling, a skill check must be made to see if the items are

dropped. Multiplying the character’s Dexterity score by 10
provides his chance of successfully juggling the objects. For

example, a character has a 76% chance of success if his
Dexterity score is 7.6. Regardless of the juggler’s agility, a
percentile roll of 99 or 100 is an automatic failure!
If juggling knives or other throwing weapons, a character can
throw one item per combat minute, while continuing to juggle

the remaining items. When such an action is attempted, the
juggler receives a -2 AV due to the awkward nature of the
attack.

Language
All character races (i.e. Berserker, Dunnar, etc.) speak a
common language known as Juravian. This language is
predominant in the world allowing communication between
the various races. Choosing the Language skill, however, allows
a character to communicate with other characters in their own

racial tongue. When the skill is selected, the Player must specify

which type of language his character will learn. Since almost

every humanoid race speaks its own language, the Player can

choose from dozens of racial tongues. Once the Language skill

is learned, a character may opt to study languages for additional

races, This does not require another skill slot but does require
two months of study. There is no limit to the number of
{anguages a character can speak. Although the character has
full comprehension of the spoken language, he is unable to
read or write the racial tongue.

Law
A character proficient in the Law skill gains an adequate
understanding of the legal practices of a specific kingdom.
Since judicial systems vary from place to place, the character

must specify which kingdom he is studying. Once learned,

he is aware of the fines and punishments for crimes, the laws
concerning contract agreements and negotiations, and has a

general understanding of the kingdom’s bylaws. Since the laws
of an empire are usually extensive, the character is unable to
grasp every aspect or remember every detail. However, without

performing any research, a character has a percentage chance
(equal to his Intellect score multiplied by 5) of recalling specific

information on demand. Learning the laws of multiple
kingdoms does not require additional skill slots, but does

require two months of study to learn.

Listening
The Listening skill heightens the character's ability to hear

sounds, voices, and noises within a 60' range. It can be used.
to listen at doors, eavesdrop on conversations in bustling
taverns, determine the number of voices speaking in a given
area, recognize familiar sounds, etc. Using the skill requires
one full minute during which time the character cannot be
disturbed. The chance for success is equal to the character's
Awareness score multiplied by 3 (rounded down).

Player’s Guide

Parrying

A warrior skilled in Parrying is able to defend himself with
greater effect by transferring points from his Attack Value to
his DV1 or DV2. The exact location of the transfer must be
stated at the beginning of each combat minute. Although this

lowers the character’s offensive capability, it increases his
defenses. This makes it harder for the parrying character to be

hic. The transfer of WSL to DV1 or DV2 is a one-to-one

ratio and may be altered as the Player sees fit. There is no
limit to the amount of the transfer. Typically, large weapons

cannot be used to parry because of their encumbering,
awkward nature. Berserkers and Ghantus however, are large
enough to use these weapons with ease, and thus can

successfully employ this skill using such weapons.
Read/Write

A character may find it useful to learn how to read and write.
To accomplish this, she must use a skill slot and choose a
language to study. Although there are no racial limitations,
one must know how to speak the language before learning its
written form (see Language skill). The character gains a 100%
knowledge of the language. Learning to read and write
additional languages does not require a skill slot, but does

require two months of training.

Running
The Running skill teaches a character to control his breathing
and pace his movements. This increases the amount of time a
character can run. The exact length of time is equal to the

character’s Stamina score multiplied by 10. In addition, once
fatigued, the runner need only rest for 10 minutes before
catching his breath.

Swimming

Learning how to swim, a character does not suffer as many
ill-effects when forced to travel through water. First, the

movement speed is reduced to only 1/2 instead of 1/4. Second,

the character suffers only a -2 AV rather than -4. Altho ugh he
gains certain benefits, the damage modifiers associated with
water combat are still valid (see Water Melee in Referee’s
Guide). Using this skill, a character will find it easy to traverse
calm, sedate waters. It may become perilous if he attempts to
travel through rough conditions, powerful currents, etc.

Two Handed Melee
Two Handed Melee allows a character to wield a weapon in
each hand during combat. Although the character cannot use
a shield, he can execute two attacks in a single combat minute.
Only small weapons (clubs, daggers, hammers, hand axes,
knives, long knives, saps, short swords, scimitars) may be used
in this fashion. The character does not receive any negative

penalties for using the weapons against the Prime Opponent,

does
but
receive
a
-3 AV if he decides to split attacks against two opponents
(e.g. attacking a Prime Opponent with one weapon and a
DV2 opponent with the other). Merikit are ambidextrous and

have this skill automatically.

Leveled Skills
Assassination, Melee (INT + DEX) x2
Learning how to assassinate, a character can kill a victim with
a single blow of a melee weapon. At the beginning of each

combat minute, the Player must specify whether his character

is attempting to assassinate an opponent. When this course of
action is selected, the character suffers a-5 Attack Value, since

he must plan and execute a precise attack. Although this

Searching
Although everyone has the ability to search for secret doors,
false bottoms and hidden objects, a character that learns this
skill gains a +25% chance of success. This modifier is added
to the character’s normal chance as determined by his
Awareness score. To search a specific object (chest, table, desk,
etc.) requires three minutes of careful observation. Searching
for a trap door or secret door requires five minutes,

negative modifier reduces the chance of hitting, a successful
blow inflicts +1 additional points of actual damage per skill

level. In addition, the character has a percentage chance (equal
to 2% per skill level) of killing the victim outright.

For example, a 1st level assassin suffers the -5 Attack Value

but successfully hits his victim. The assassin wields a longsword

and inflicts 1d10 points of damage. Failing the percentage
chance of assassination (2%), the assassin rolls the damage

and scores a 6. Normally, this inflicts 1 point of actual damage

Singing
When Singing is learned, a character becomes fluent at reading
music and keeping pitch. With or without musical
accompaniment, the singing sounds professional, pleasant and
clear. It is not uncommon to find bards singing in local taverns

as a way of generating income.

and 5 points of armor damage. However, the skill increases
the amount of actual damage inflicted by +1 per skill level.

This results in the character causing 2 points of actual damage
and 5 points to the creature’s armor. If the character were
level 2 in the skill, he would have inflicted 3 points of actual
damage, etc.
Undead, humanoids that are larger than man-sized, and

Sleight of Hand
This skill allows a character the ability to perform quick
movements with her hands, much like the standard magic

animals that have in excess of 50 Hit Points cannot be
assassinated, but will still suffer the additional damage
associated with the attack.

Credit toward skill advancement is gained for every successful

hit, whether or not the percentage rollfor assassination succeeds,

Assassination, Missile (INT + DEX) x2

A very deadly skill, Assassination Missile enables a character to
automatically kill a victim with a single arrow or crossbow
bolt. Before firing the weapon, the Player must specify whether
her character is attempting to assassinate. Like the melee
version, the archer suffers an Attack Value penalty. However,
due to the accuracy needed to kill a victim with a single shot,
the archer receives a -8 AV. With each successful hit, the
character inflicts an additional +1 point of actual damage per
skill level. In addition, she has a percentage chance (equal to
1% per skill level) of killing the victim outright.

For example, a character that is 3rd level in the Assassination

Missile skill successfully hits the target with a longbow, but

fails to roll her percentage chance for assassination (3%). The
archer rolls 1d6 to determine damage and scores a 4. The

longbow typically inflicts 1 point of damage to the victim's

armor and the remaining damage is deducted from its Hit
Points. However, the character inflicts +3 points of actual
damage (because of her skill level). This results in 1 point of
armor damage and 6 points to the victim’s Hit Points.
Undead, humanoids that are larger than man-sized, and
animals that have in excess of 50 Hit Points cannot be
assassinated, but will still suffer the additional damage
associated with the attack.
Credit toward skill advancement is gained for every successful
hit, whether or not the percentage rollfor assassination succeeds.

Backstabbing (INT + DEX) x2

Through careful study of humanoid anatomy, a character
skilled in Backstabbing learns to inflict crippling wounds with
a melee weapon. Each successful hit inflicts +1 actual damage

for every two levels of skill (ie. 1st and 2nd level would inflict

+1, 3rd and 4th level would inflict +2, etc.) Backstabbing can
only be used on humanoid creatures that are man-sized or
smaller. In addition, regardless of the weapon used, only one

attack per combat minute may be employed. Attacks must be

made upon the victim’s DV2 (from the side or behind) or else

the skill is ineffective. Every successful hit grants the character
credits in both the Weapon skill and Backstabbing advancement.

Brawling (STR + DEX) x2
Brawling allows a character the ability to fight in melee combat
using nothing more than his bare fists. When a character uses
this skill, he inflicts 1d2 points of damage, which is modified

by the Strength characteristic. The character's Attack Value is
equal to 1 per skill level, and may be modified by the character's

Dexterity. A character earns a credit toward skill advancement
for each successful hit. Wearing gauntlets can increase damage
inflicted through Brawling. In addition, Ghantu have the racial

benefit of claws and inflict 1d4 points of damage per hit.

Magic (INT + INS) x2
The Magic skill is a detailed part of the Forge: Out of Chaos

role-playing system. Because of the strict mental disciplines

needed to manipulate spells, it is impossible for a character to
learn two types of magic without going insane. When the
skill is chosen, the Player must specify which sphere of magic
his character studies (Divine Magic or Pagan Magic). Although

both allow spell casting, they have significant differences. Once
a sphere is studied, the Player must select one type of magic

for his character to learn, The six types of magic are Beast,

Berethenu, Elemental, Enchantment, Grom and Necromancy.

Divine Magic (Berethenu and Grom) is granted by the
immortals. Learning either of these requires exactly 10 skill

slots. Wizards of this type of magic draw their power from the

gods (who are imprisoned in Mulkra). Since the powers are
divine, the mages are in no danger from the use of this magic

nor do they require physical components to cast spells.

Pagan Magic (Beast, Elemental, Enchantment and
Necromancy) uses physical components to harness the magical

energies. Because the powers are not divinely granted, the

magic has harmful side effects! Learning one of these requires

a minimum of 10 skill slots. Although this grants rudimentary

knowledge of the skill, a wizard can become far more powerful

by investing more skill slots in this proficiency. Up to 20 skill

slots may be placed into magic. With each additional slot over
the minimum, a wizard gains bonuses toward learning spells
and has a lesser chance of breaking components.

Shield, Buckler (STR + DEX) x2
When trained in this skill, the character is able to attack with
a one-handed weapon and his buckler shield in the same
combat minute. The warrior can also use the shield in defense.

Although the first weapon must be employed against the

character’s Prime Opponent, the buckler shield can only be
used against a creature attacking the character’s DV2. The
intense training necessary to learn this skill negates the normal
Attack Value penalties associated with Two Handed Melee. This

skill only allows the use of the buckler shield as a secondary

weapon. For each successful hit, the character inflicts 1d4
points of damage (no Strength modifiers are allowed) and gains
one credit toward skill advancement. Like other Melee Weapon
Skills, the character gains a +1 Attack Value for each level
gained. It is important to note that, when using the buckler

shield as a weapon, the character does not add his Dexterity
modifiers to determine Attack Value.

When dealing with the majority of spell casters (Berethenu
Knights, Grom Warriors, Beast Mages, Elementalists and
Necromancers), a character earns one credit toward Magic skill

advancement for each spell he or she casts. In addition, the

spells have a limited duration. Once the time limit has expired,

the effects dissipate.

Enchanter magic varies from the above rule. First, an Enchanter
gains one credit toward Magic advancement for each spell level
cast. Therefore, casting a 3rd level spell would entitle the
character to three skill credits. Another difference is that

Enchanters can maintain a spell’s effect indefinitely. This is

done through the use of Maintenance Points. Each day, the
wizard decides which spells he will keep in effect and which
ones he will allow to dissolve. Keeping spells active benefits
the wizard in multiple ways. First, the spell remains in effect
and grants the wizard the appropriate bonuses. Second, the
Enchanter gains two credits toward Magic skill advancement

providing he keeps at least one spell active for an entire week.

Since these magicians cast fewer spells than most wizards, they

tend to advance more slowly and require longer periods of
time to reach high levels.

Spell Points (SPTS) are required to cast any type of magic. To
calculate a character’s SPTS, multiply his Power score by two.

This becomes the wizard’s maximum Spell Point value. Upon

gaining a level in the Magic skill, the character gains additional
SPTS and raises his maximum value. When he advances, the
wizard is entitled to add his Power characteristic to a 1d6 roll.
This combined score is then added to the character’s SPTS.
For example, an Enchanter with a 17 Power would have 34

Throwing (STR + DEX) x2
Learning how to throw (darts, javelins, knives, oil flasks, rocks,
and spears), a character gains a +1 Attack Value for each skill
level he possesses in the Throwing skill. Keep in mind that a
character need only hit a target’s DV2 when attacking. If the
skill is not learned, a character is considered to have a 0 Weapon
Skill Level.

Weapons, Melee (STR + DEX) x2

The character must choose one melee weapon (from the list
of 29) in which to train. Once selected, the warrior becomes
familiar with the weapon and is eligible to gain levels. With
each successful hit, the character earns one credit toward skill
advancement. For each skill level the character earns, he
receives a +1 Attack Value. More importantly, as higher levels
are attained in a melee weapon, the character inflicts more
actual damage with each attack. The following table illustrates
the additional damage inflicted based on skill level.
Remember, a character that is not proficient in a weapon has
an Weapon Skill Level of 0 and is not eligible for “credits”
toward skill advancement. The character’s Strength score is

used to modify damage inflicted by melee weapons.

Spell Points at 1st level. Upon gaining a level, he would roll

1d6 and add +17. This value (18-23) would be added to his
SPTS. If the result were a 3 on the six-sided die, he would be
eligible to add 20 points to his previous total of 34. This gives
the wizard 54 Spell Points at 2nd level.

Spell Points are consumed each time a spell is cast and must

be subtracted from the character’s maximum Spell Point value.
The most common method for regaining SPTS is by sleeping.
For every two hours of continuous sleep, a wizard will regain
5 SPTS. The maximum amount regained each day is 20.

arrow, bolt or sling stone is constant and does not increase.

Removing a trap is a difficult task, but characters with the
Disarm Trap skill learn to do it with relative ease. Once a
character discovers a trap (via the Find Traps skill), he is
required to roll 1d100 to disarm it. A score equal to or lower
than the character’s skill base results in a success. Success means
the character receives one credit toward skill advancement,
and the trap was disarmed without difficulty. A failure results
in the trap being triggered and the character suffers appropriate

Keep in mind that an archer is only required to hit his target's

Like melee weapons, a character must specify one weapon
(heavy crossbow, light crossbow, long bow, short bow, or sling)
in which to train. Once the weapon is selected, the character
is eligible to gain levels. Each successful hit earns the archer a
credit toward skill advancement. For each skill level she attains

in the weapon, her Attack Value is increased by +1. Unlike

DV2 in order to cause damage. A character that is not skilled
in a missile weapon is considered to have an WSL of 0. Lastly,

Blind Fighting (DEX + AWR)

When a character is blinded, he suffers severe combat penalties.

The Blind Fighting skill teaches a warrior to use his auditory
and olfactory senses to compensate for lack of vision. ‘This

reduces the -10 AV penalty that normally accompanies blind

combat. The table below illustrates the character’s AV modifier
determined by his skill base. As a character nears 100% in the

proficiency, the negative combat values are less severe. Each

time a blinded character strikes an enemy, he gains one credit

of the skill.

Climbing (DEX x2)

Using this skill, characters are able to ascend or descend vertical
surfaces. This skill is useful when attempting to climb
mountains, trees, or obstacles. When attempting to climb the
character must roll 1d100 and score equal to or below his
current skill base. Each successful roll reflects 10' of vertical
movement. If the roll is a failure, the character plummets to
the ground and sustains appropriate damage (see Falling). The

Final Blow (INT + DEX)

When a character causes enough damage to place his Prime
Opponent at 0 or negative Hit Points (rendering it
unconscious), this skill allows the character to strike the victim
again as it falls to the ground. This action, performed at the

end of the combat minute, does not require a roll to hit, nor

does it affect fighting ability. Rolling 1d100, the character
must score equal to or lower than his skill base to successfully
kill the target creature. The target creature is immediately dead.
Only a Resurrection spell will return the creature to life. This
earns the character one credit toward skill advancement but
does not count toward Weapon skill advancement. A failure
indicates the character did not strike his fallen victim.

Man-sized characters may only employ one-handed weapons

when using this skill. Larger than man-sized creatures, due to

their greater mass, are able to use any weapon.

Find Traps (INT + AWR)

Before you pick that lock or walk down that narrow hallway,

perhaps you should look for a trap. Whenever the character
uses this skill, the Referee must roll 1d100. A score equal to
or lower than the character’s skill base results in a success. Ifa
trap is present, the character receives one credit toward skill
advancement and discovers the location and nature of the
mechanism (darts, gas, pit, poison needle, etc.). If there is no
trap, a credit is not earned but the character knows that no
trap exists. A failure indicates the character is unable to detect
the presence of a trap. The skill requires 5 minutes of careful

observation. This skill only detects a hazard. To remove traps,
one must learn the Disarm Traps skill.

Gaze Evasion (INT + AWR)

Certain monsters (e.g. Cavasha, Death Hag) have gaze attacks
that cause harmful effects. When fighting these creatures, a
warrior might attempt to avert his gaze and avoid the danger.
When done, the character receives a -5 AV and still has a

chance of being affected by the monster’s eyes. The Gaze

Giant Fighting (DEX + AWR)

When fighting Cyclops, Giants, Ogres, or ‘Trolls, this skill

increases the character’s DV1. Each combat minute (before
the initiative are rolled), the Player must roll 1d100. A score
equal to or lower than the character’s skill base results in a
success, For that combat minute, the character adds +5 to his
DV1. If the attempt is a failure, the character only receives a
+1 DV1. A credit toward advancement is gained for each
successful skill roll.

Hiding (INT + DEX)

The Hiding skill gives a character the ability to use natural
surroundings as camouflage. When a Player announces that

his character is going to hide, the Referee should secretly roll

1d100 against the character's skill base. If the roll is equal to
or lower than the base, the character has succeeded in hiding
and cannot be seen. If the result is a failure, the character is

not completely hidden and monsters will detect him. In any

case, the character is unaware of his success or failure. To use
this skill, the character must have shadows or natural
surroundings sufficient for hiding. The Referee should feel
free to modify the chance based upon the terrain. If the
modification is a positive one, the character does not receive a

credit toward advancement. Although the terrain typically

affects the chances of hiding, the armor worn by the character

has a definite effect on the success of the attempt. The following
table illustrates the negative modifiers associated with the

various types of armor.

Leadership (STR + INT)

Taking control of combat situations like a military leader, the
character attempts to bolster the morale of his allies. At the

start of the combat, 1d100 must be rolled. If the result is

equal to or lower than the character’s skill base, all friendly

characters within a 30' diameter gain a +1 AV, and the
character receives one credit toward advancement in the skill.
The modifier lasts until the “leader” flees, is killed, or the

battle is over. Only one attempt may be made per combat.

Although Leadership increases the characters’ chances of
hitting, it does not disqualify them from credit toward Weapon
skill advancement. If the attempt is failed, no benefit is gained.
The skill requires 1 full minute to perform. Characters that
have the benefit of Charisma add +10% to their skill base.

Missile Evasion (DEX + AWR)

Missile weapons are deadly, needing only to strike a character’s

DV2. When the Missile Evasion skill is learned a character

may use his Awareness modifier to defend against missile

attacks. When an archer fires an arrow at the character, the

Player should roll 1d100. A score equal to or lower than the

character’s skill base results in a success. This increases his
character's DV2, making it harder to be hit. Note that the
character must be able to see the archer in order to use the
skill. Without an exceptional Awareness characteristic, the
Missile Evasion skill offers no protection.

Mounted Combat, Melee (DEX + AWR)

A character must first have the FAlorsemanship skill before he
can learn to fight from horseback. Even for those skilled in
riding, mounted combat ts a difficult task. Because of this,

there is a -3 AV penalty normally associated with using melee

weapons while on a steed. Learning the Mounted Combat Melee
skill reduces this negative AV modifier. As the character

increases his skill base, he fights more effectively. Eventually,
when the skill is mastered (100%), the character will actually
gain a +1 Attack Value while mounted. Credit toward skill
advancement is gained for each successful hit in combat, Not

only does this qualify the character for Mounted Combat

advancement, but for his Weapon skill advancement as well.

Mounted Combat, Missile (DEX + AWR)

Before learning this skill, a character must be proficient in
Horsemanship. Since using a missile weapon from horseback
is awkward, a character receives a -4 Attack Value penalty when

employing a bow, crossbow or sling while mounted. As the

character increases his knowledge in the Mounted Combat
Missile skill, the negative modifier is reduced. Credit toward

skill advancement is gained for each successful hit in combat.

Not only does this qualify the character for Mounted Combat
advancement, bur for his Weapon skill advancement as well.

Move Silently (DEX x2)

Surprising creatures is easier when they cannot hear you

approach. The Move Silently skill allows a character to move
1/4 his normal walking rate without making a sound. Each

minute a character attempts to use the skill, the Player must

roll 1d100 to ensure silent movement. The character’s skill

base is modified downward based upon the type of armor

worn (shown on the table below). Not a sound is made when
the score is equal to or below the character’s modified skill
base. In addition, the character receives one credit toward skill
advancement. A failed attempt, however, might alert creatures

in a 30’ area to the character’s presence. Characters that remain
silent can achieve surprise on unsuspecting creatures, gaining
a free attack.

Open Locks (INT + DEX)

What's behind that locked door? Sometimes a character may

need to pick a lock. This requires 2 full minutes of

manipulation using a lock pick. When the skill is attempted,

the Player is required to roll 1d100. The result must be equal
to or lower than the character’s skill base. Furthermore, this

chance is modified downward based upon the complexity of

the lock. Locking devices have ratings between 0-6, with each

one reducing a character’s chance by 10% (0-60%). Regardless

of the character’s chances, any roll of 99 or 100 breaks the

attempt at unlocking the mechanism. If successful, the lock is
opened and the character gains one credit toward skill

using natural camouflage, natural surroundings, or even the
Hiding skill. When Observation is used, the Referee must roll

1d100 with the result being equal to or lower than the
character’s skill base. A success indicates that any hidden

creatures were discovered and the character earns one credit
toward advancement. If there were no creatures hiding in the
area, the character does not earn a credit. If the result is a

failure, the character does not see anything. There are two
important considerations to note. First, the skill will not detect

creatures that are magically hidden. Second, the creatures must
be in the sight range of the character. The skill requires 1 full
minute to employ.

Although useful in opening locks, this skill cannot be used to

discover traps (see Find Traps) or remove them (see Disarm
Traps).

Pick Pockets (INT + DEX)

Beware crowded taverns! Learning how to pick pockets enables
a thief to steal sacks and items from unsuspecting creatures.
When the skill is used, the Player is required to roll 1d100.
The score must be equal to or lower than his character's skill
base. If successful, the thief gains one credit toward skill

advancement and steals the sack, necklace, ring or other item
from a creature standing within 5’. If failed, the victim is aware

of the attempt and may take action. It is the Referee’s option

Player’s Guide

to modify the character’s chance of stealing depending on the
circumstances. For example, stealing from a drunkard who

can barely see is far easier than attempting to take a ring off
the finger of a merchant surrounded by guards. If a beneficial

modifier is granted, the character will not qualify for skill
advancement.
Plant ID (INT x2)
The Plant ID skill grants knowledge of plants, molds, roots,

and fungi. This is handy when adventuring in areas thick with
vegetation. By learning the skill, a character can automatically

direction, how many sets of prints are present, and how long

ago they were made. If there are no tracks, the character will

know there is nothing in the area and will not earn an
advancement credit. If the result is failed, the character will

not discover any tracks (whether they were there or not). The
Referee can modify the character's skill attempt depending
on the circumstances. Obviously, tracking outdoors in a

thunderstorm is far more difficult than tracking in a deserted,

dusty dungeon. If the Referee decides to grant a positive

a character could identify hemlock, poison ivy, and poison

Healing Roots, Gray Mold, and Vigoshian roots), the Player
must roll 1d100 to identify them. If the result is equal to or

lower than the character’s skill base, it isa success. The character
earns one credit toward skill advancement and knows the name
and properties of the plant in question. Failure indicates that
the character is unable to identify the plant.

Tactics (DEX + AWR)

Need to defend yourself against multiple opponents? The
Tactics skill enhances a character's DV2 rating during melee
combat. At the beginning of each combat minute, before
rolling initiative, the Player must roll 1d100. If the score is
equal to or lower than his character’s skill base, it is a success,

Not only does it earn the character one credit toward skill

advancement, it grants a +1 to his DV2 and also allows him
to add his Awareness modifier to his DV2. If the roll is failed,
the skill has no effect.

Track ID (INT x2)

The Track ID skill is only a function of tracking and does not
allow a person to discover or follow tracks (see the Tracking
skill). The character can look at a set of tracks and determine
what creature made them. There are two categories under this

proficiency: Humanoid and Animal. Each category has its
own skill base that must be maintained separately. Whenever

tracks are encountered, a character can automatically determine
if humanoids or animals made them. In addition, the Player
must roll 1d100. If the score is equal to or lower than the
character’s skill base in the given category, then it is a success.
This earns the character one credit toward skill advancement

(in the appropriate category) and informs the character as to
the type of creature that made the tracks (ie. Ghantu, Griffon,
Manticore, Merikii, Tursks, etc.). Only one attempt can be

made and if it fails, the character gains no knowledge. The
skill requires 2 minutes to employ.

Tracking (INT x2)

When using the Tracking skill, a character can check the general

terrain for any noticeable tracks or signs of passing. When the
Player decides to use the skill, the Referee should roll 14100.
If the score is equal to or lower than the character’s skill base,

the attempt is successful. If there are tracks in the general
area, the character will find them and earn one credit toward
skill advancement. In addition, he is able to determine their

Tumbling (DEX x2)

can fall up to 30' without sustaining damage. When a character
skilled in Tumbling falls from any height greater than 9’, the

Player must roll 14100. If the result is equal to or less than his
character's skill base, it is a success. Not only does the character

gain one credit toward skill advancement; he also suffers no
damage from the fall. Even if the attempt fails, the character
only takes 1/2 damage (see Falling). The skill offers no benefit
to characters that fall from a height greater than 30'.

Weapon Stomp (DEX + AWR)

Sometimes an enemy will drop its weapon in melee combat.
With the Weapon Stomp skill, a warrior can take advantage of
this situation. When a Prime Opponent drops its weapon (rolls
a “1” on its d20), the Player must roll 14100. A score equal to
or less than the character's skill base results in a success. The
character gains one credit toward skill advancement and
successfully steps on the weapon, prohibiting is retrieval.
Without its weapon, the opponent is forced to draw another
weapon, attack with its fists, or retreat. If the skill attempt
fails, the opponent retrieves the weapon without penalty and
combat continues as usual.

Buying Supplies

Once the character has learned skills, he must buy equipment.
It is the Referee’s obligation to give each character a certain
amount of money at the beginning of the game. Using this
money, each Player will look over the equipment chart and
buy desired supplies. A weapon is very important and should
be the first consideration. The next worry is food and drink.

Without it, your character will starve or dehydrate. Few take-

out restaurants will deliver to the middle ofa fallen dungeon.
Next, buy armor, healing roots, torches, tinderbox, mapping
supplies, and any other item required by your character.

Descriptions of Armor and Supplies

Ale, pint - stored in a small animal skin, ale is a common
drink served in taverns and inns across the lands. Finding a
band of adventurers drinking around acampfire after a glorious
victory is common. Ale is typically watered down and is not
very potent, making it the poor man’s drink.
Armor, banded - grants the character a 6 Armor Rating. It

can absorb up to 60 points of damage before being destroyed.

The repair of this armor requires banded repair kits,

double-bladed axe head. The awkward weight of the battleaxe prohibits it from being thrown. It was designed by Dwarves
to be wielded in one hand, allowing them to use shields.
Humans quickly adapted it to their mounted cavalry units.
When used from horseback, it inflicts +2 damage.
Axe, hand (1d6) - the smallest and lightest of the axes,
characters can use it as a missile weapon. Although it inflicts
normal damage when used in melee combat, the wielder gains
a +2 damage modifier when wielding it from horseback.
Axe, mattock (2d6) - two hands are needed to swing this
massive weapon, prohibiting the use of a shield. The weapon
inflicts serious damage against adversaries and is a preferred
weapon of Ghantu warriors. Due to the mattock’s weight, it

may not be thrown.

Backpack - a leather knapsack used by adventurers and
travelers as a vessel for carrying food, items, and treasure. Each
backpack is divided into sections. The item can carry a
maximum of 500 coins. Although most adventurers would
prefer it filled with gold, carrying essentials such as food is
necessary while exploring dungeons or catacombs.
Bedroll - usually attached to a backpack and used as a sleeping
bag by adventurers. The item is lightweight and compact.

Armor, chain - links of chain and a leather tunic offer a 5

Armor Rating. Chain armor can absorb up to 50 points of
damage. Repairing such armor requires chain repair kits.

of 2. It can absorb up to 20 Armor Points worth of damage.

Repairing the armor requires leather repair kits.

Bolts, score - sold in groups of 20 and used with light and
heavy crossbows. They are crafted from wood and are known
for their armor piercing quality. Like arrows, they are generally
carried in a quiver.

Boots, hiking - made for hiking and long journeys. They are
made of durable leather and will last for many months.
Bow, long (1d6) - a very powerful weapon. Like the crossbows,

most of the damage is deducted from the Hit Points of the
target while armor absorbs only 1 point. The weapon may be

employed once each combat minute but may not be used on

horseback.
Player’s Guide

Bow, short (1d3) - is usable both on horseback and on foot.
The range of the weapon is shorter than that of a long bow or

heavy crossbow and each arrow inflicts damage equal to 1d3.

One point of damage is deducted from the Hit Points of the
victim while the victim’s armor absorbs the rest. Characters
may fire the weapon twice per combat minute.
Bowstring — when using a long or short bow, rolling a natural
“1” on the attack roll causes the bowstring to break. This leaves
the weapon useless until restrung. For this reason, extra
bowstrings are important to keep on hand.

Brye Leaf - this medicinal plant may counteract the poison of
a Mevoshk (see Monsters) when crushed and applied to the
bite wound.

Cloak, traveling - light and waterproof, the traveling cloak
will protect the wearer from light winds and rain.

clothing that commoners wear. Normal clothing can be

Drum - a small percussion instrument.

Emerki - a fungus that grows in marshes, Emerki resembles a
fine film or scum. When ingested, this fungus increases
resistance to mental attacks, granting the user a +4 Saving

skilled in Field Repair. Without these tools, characters may
not perform the Field Repair skill. Besides the tools, the case
comes with a storage compartment that holds 50 repair kits.

The kits are not included with the case and must be purchased
separately.
Flail (2d6) - developed to attack mounted warriors, this
weapon is made from wood and reinforced with metal. The
item consists of two separate rods each reaching a length of 3’
and connected by a section of chain. One rod is used as the

handle and is large enough to support a two-handed grip.
The other rod sports metal studs. The weapon requires two

hands to wield. When used against mounted opponents, the
weapon negates the attacker’s -2 Attack Value penalty.

pile of your favorite tavern. The club inflicts 1d6 points of
damage. This damage increases by +2 when used from
horseback.

Crossbow, Heavy (1d8) - due to the awkwardness of reloading

the weapon, characters may only fire it once every two combat

minutes. Each successful hit inflicts 1d8 points of damage.
Unlike standard weapons, the crossbow bolt inflicts only 1
point of damage to the victim’s armor, while the remaining

damage is deducted directly from its Hit Points.

Crossbow, Light (1d4) - smaller and less awkward than the

heavy crossbow, characters may fire this weapon once every
combat minute. Each successful hit inflicts only 1 point of
damage to the armor of the victim and the remaining damage
is deducted from its Hit Points.

Dagger (1d4) - a small-bladed weapon used in melee combat

or as a missile weapon.

Dart (1d2) - a small, feathered throwing weapon. Due to its

small, lightweight and aerodynamic design, characters
throwing darts receive a +2 AV. This does not disqualify the

Garrote (1d3) - illegal in many kingdoms, this weapon is
commonly used by assassins and thieves. The item is nothing
more than a strong, thin cord that can be used to strangle
potential victims. All damage inflicted by the weapon is actual
damage and must be deducted directly from the victim’s Hit
Points. Neck guards, which protect against the garrote’s use,
are included with ring mail, chain mail, banded mail, and
plate armor. The weapon requires two hands to use and does
not allow a Strength modifier to increase damage. Note that

once the weapon successfully hits, damage is inflicted
automatically each combat minute. Victims will be unable to
speak and will suffer a -5 Attack Value penalty.

Gauntlet (1d2+1) - leather gloves fitted with iron studs to
inflict more damage than a bare fist. Gauntlets increase the
damage inflicted with a punch by 1 point. Strength modifiers

still apply. Note: Creatures having claws cannot use gauntlets.

or occasional use), the mold will wither and die. Adventurers

have found this type of vegetation very useful in dungeon
and underground exploration.
Quiver - made from leather or animal hide, this item holds
24 arrows or bolts and may be worn over the shoulder.
Rations, standard, week - far more appetizing than traveling
rations, these foodstuffs spoil after two weeks. These rations
are better for short journeys and are often used by merchants.
Rations, traveling, week - consists of salted meats and roots.
Although they are edible and sustain life, traveling rations
have a bitter, salty taste. Typically, this is the food of adventurers
for it will remain preserved for several months.

Robe, thick - comes with a large, cowled hood. It covers the
wearer from head to toe. A robe is typically worn by Dunnar

who are Photosensitive (suffer damage from sunlight). A robe

does not offer any protection, nor does it absorb damage.

Rope, coil 100' - useful for climbing and lowering or raising
objects. Each coil of rope can support 2,000 pounds. Attacks
on the item should be made against a 0 AR. Severing will

occur ifany sharp object inflicts more than 5 points of damage.

{in conjunction with a normal attack), the wielder suffers a
-3 Attack Value due to the awkward nature of the attack.
Learning the Buckler Shield skill nullifies this detriment. If

the shield suffers enough damage to be destroyed, the offensive

capability of the item is lost. In addition to the Attack Value

penalty, the spiked buckler can only be used as a weapon every

other combat minute (1/2). Also, it can only be used against
creatures attacking the character’s DV2. Should an attack with
the buckler result in a natural “20” (see Combat) to hit, the

spike is broken and the shield may no longer be used as a

weapon.

Shield, tower - has 25 Shield Points and a 3 Shield Rating. A

tower shield is often painted with symbols or family crests.

Due to its size, this shield may not be used from horseback.

Shield, wooden - has 5 Shield Points and a 1 Shield Rating.
Sling (1d4) - a small weapon invented by Sprites. The weapon
can be used with any normal stone and can inflict damage
from a distance. In addition, the weapon can be easily hidden.
Spear (2d4) - may be thrown from a distance or used in melee
combat. In either event, the wielder is unable to use a shield.

combat minute and inflicts 1d2 points of damage. Each time
it hits, it has a 1% chance of rendering its humanoid target

unconscious. This chance is increased by +1% for every 2 full

points of Strength the user possesses (rounded down). A
character with a 12 Strength has a 7% chance per hit of
knocking its opponent unconscious while another with a 7
Strength has only a 4% chance. When used against defenders
wearing helms, the sap is less effective. Normal helms reduce

the chance by 4% and great helms reduce it by 10%.

Scroll Case - made from bone, ivory, or other materials, this

item is used to keep parchments (maps, letters, etc.) dry and
safe. A scroll case is waterproof and the item can even sustain
minor damage from fire before its contents are destroyed.
Shield, large - has 15 Shield Points and a 2 Shield Rating.
Shield, small — has 10 Shield Points and a 1 Shield Rating.
Shield, spiked buckler (1d4) - crafted from metal and wood,
the buckler shield (like a normal shield) absorbs up to 10

points of damage before being destroyed. In addition to its
defensive value, this shield is equipped with a large spike that

may be used in combat. When the buckler is used as a weapon

Player’s Guide

the boar spear cannot be used as a missile weapon.

Staff (1d6) - a two-handed weapon that is blunt and may be
used against Skeletons and Giant Skeletons to great effect.
The weapon has a length that ranges between 5' and 7’.
Staff, quarter (1d8) - resembles a normal staff except it is
reinforced with iron, which increases damage potential and
durability in combat. This weapon requires two hands to wield.
Sword, bastard (2d6) - a two-handed weapon, the bastard
sword is a smaller version of the two-handed sword, but is

more maneuverable. Although the weapon inflicts less damage

than its larger cousin, a bastard sword may be used once per

combat minute. The length of the weapon negates the -2 AV
penalty associated with fighting mounted opponents.
Sword, broad (1d8+1) - a modified version of the longsword.
Although strengthened to increase the weapon's durability,

the blade is not as sharp and has a lower damage potential.
Sword, long (1d 10) - thinner and less durable than the larger
swords, it can still inflict impressive damage in melee combat.
The sword reaches a length of 3-3 1/2' and may be used in
one hand, allowing the wielder to use a shield.

Sword, sagax dentir (2d4) - crafted by the Ghantu, the sagax
dentir has become the preferred weapon in their tribal regions.
The sagax dentir is a long, flat-bladed weapon that must be
wielded with two hands. The edges of the blade are serrated
allowing damage to be inflicted by the initial blow, and again
upon the blade’s withdrawal from the opponent. A character
must have a 10.5 Strength to wield it. Any successful hit inflicts
2d4 points of damage (plus any Strength modifier). At the
end of the same combat minute, the character inflicts another
1d4 points of actual damage (no Strength modifier allowed).
If the wielder does not have the appropriate Strength, the

character can only inflict the initial 2d4 points of damage.

Sword, scimitar (1d6+1) - a small, slashing weapon with a
curved blade, the scimitar reaches a length of only 2'. Designed

by the Merikii as a melee weapon, the blade offers average
damage capability. When used from horseback, these weapons

gain a +2 damage modifier.

Sword, short (1d6) - the wielder is free to use a shield for

defense and can still use the weapon once per combat minute.

Sword, two-handed (3d6) - the blade reaches a length of 6’.
Its size and awkwardness requires two hands to wield,

prohibiting the use of a shield. It can only be used once every
other combat minute, but inflicts the most damage of any
melee weapon. Due to its length, the weapon negates the -2
AV penalty associated with attacking mounted opponents.
Tinderbox - used to create sparks and aid in lighting campfires,
lanterns, torches, or igniting oil flasks.

Torch - used as a source of illumination. Torches give off light
in a 15' diameter and last for 60 minutes. Wise adventurers
always carry a few torches with them when exploring.
Vigoshian Root - found in dark, subterranean areas. When
eaten, a Vigoshian root temporarily increases an individual’s

Spell Points by 10-60 (10d6). This increase lasts for 60 minutes

or until the bonus points are used. There is a 50% chance per
root ingested that the user will suffer severe side effects and
lose 0.1d3 Insight. This detriment is permanent and affects
the character’s skill slots and maximum attainable spell level.
There is no cure for this side effect. Despite this detriment,

spell casters covet the root. Spell casters may exceed their
maximum Spell Point potential when using this root.

Waterskin - holds enough water to last three days. Water skins
can be refilled at streams, wells, or other sources.
Whip (1d4) - unlike other weapons, the whip causes no
additional damage when a natural “20” is rolled, nor does it
sustain notches. Each hit inflicts 1d4 points of damage, which

is modified by the Strength of the character. For every 10

points of armor the target is wearing the target subtracts 1
point of damage (rounded down). Although armor lessens
the damage, the minimum damage the weapon inflicts is 1

point of actual damage.

Wine, pint - sold in skins that hold a few draughts. Wine is
the drink of merchants and other distinguished characters.

Sample Character

The following is an example of how to generate a character

for the Forge: Out of Chaos system.

Paul wants to craft a big, butt-kicking warrior. For the first six
characteristics of this character he rolls 2d6 and 1d10. His
results: 9.0, 9.7, 6.0, 12.8, 4.3 and 11.6. Paul then rolls his
Speed, Power and Luck. (Remember! Since the last three

characteristics are generated through unique methods, they
cannot be juggled. Speed, Power and Luck remain constant.)
Paul rolls a 3 Speed, a 17 Power, and his Luck is 12.

Because the first six characteristics are interchangeable, Paul

places the 12.8 in Strength, 9.7 in Stamina, 6.0 in Intellect,
4.3 in Insight, 11.6 in Dexterity, and the 9.0 in Awareness.
He knows that having high Strength, Dexterity, and Stamina

values is advantageous to a burly warrior, so he chooses to

place his highest scores in these areas. Conversely, Intellect

and Insight are not as important to him, so his lower scores
are relegated to these characteristics. His last stat, 9.0, is put
in Awareness, giving him a +1 DV1 for combat situations.
Next, Paul looks at all the races and considers the Ghantu.
Due to its large size, this massive brute gains +2.0 to its Strength
score and has the benefit of Thick Hides, which provides natural

protection. He ponders the detriments of having a single eye
(which lowers his ability to use missile weapons) and the

learning disability (which lessens the number of skills he can
learn), but decides that a Ghantu would make a perfect warrior.
He increases his Strength to 14.8, jots down the benefits and
detriments and continues.
Once he decides characteristics, Paul figures out his
characteristic modifiers. He finds his high Strength grants him
+4 damage in melee combat, his Stamina gives him 19 Hie
Points, and his Dexterity allows him a +2 Attack Value. His

combined Intellect and Insight scores are 10.3, giving him 10
skill slots (always round down). Because his race has a learning

disability, it reduces his maximum number of skill slots by
50%. This means that his character will only have 5 skill slots.

Paul moves on to selecting skills. He ponders the skill list
carefully since he has only a few skill slots. He first chooses
the Exceptional Stamina skill. This Basic skill does not have a
percentage base, nor does it increase with use. It does, however,
raise the character’s Stamina score by +1.0. This gives his
character a 10.7 Stamina and a total of 21 Hit Points. Paul
deducts a skill slot. His character has four remaining.

Paul chooses a weapon, the mattock, for his new character.

This is a Leveled skill and its percentage base is determined

by adding his Strength and Dexterity scores and multiplying

the result by 2. This equals a 52% base (which was rounded
down). He records that he is 1st level in the Mattock skill, that
he has a 52% base and that he has 3 skill slots remaining. He
knows that his Weapon skill will increase through combat and

that, as he gains levels, his combat ability will improve.

Then, Paul chooses the Weapon Stomp skill. This Percentage
skill has a base determined by adding the character’s Dexterity
Player’s Guide

and Awareness scores. For Paul’s Ghantu, this results in a 20%
base (again rounded down). Like his skill in the mattock, this

proficiency increases through use. Subtracting another skill
slot, his character has just 2 remaining. Instead of choosing
them now, Paul decides that he will wait and learn them during

his adventurers. Eager to play, he moves on to buying supplies.

The Referee tells him to roll 3d6 and multiply the score by 10
to determine his character's starting gold. Throwing the dice,
he scores an 11, giving Paul 110 gold to buy supplies. Turning
to the supply listing, he decides to get leather armor for
protection. He needs his mattock to use in combat. He buys
a backpack to hold his belongings. Requiring food and water,
he purchases two weeks of traveling rations and one waterskin.
Unsure of his destination, he spends some money on a
tinderbox, two oil flasks, and five torches to provide
illumination. He buys two healing roots so he can restore lost
Hit Points and purchases a set of hiking boots for his journey.
He now has 6 gold and 50 silver coins left over, which he
intends to spend at the first tavern that he encounters.
Moving on to the next step, Paul calculates his warrior’s combat
values. His Attack Value when using a mattock is a 3. This is
determined by adding his Weapon skill level (1) with his
Dexterity modifiers (+2). When using any other weapon, the
Ghantu would only have a 2 AV since he would have a 0
Weapon skill level. Next, he determines his DV1. This is
calculated by adding his Armor Rating (2), Shield Rating (0)
and Awareness modifier (+1). Normally he would have a 3
DV1, however, Paul’s character is a Ghantu and has the racial
benefit of Thick Hides. This raises his Armor Rating by 1
which affects both his DV1 and DV2, giving him a total of a

4 DV1. Lastly, he determines his DV2. This is simply the

character's Armor Rating (2) added with his bonus for Thick
Hides (1). His DV2 is 3.

Finally,
Y Paul searches his brain for a name. Grinning & ear to

ear, he writes down the name of his new character, “Pic.”

Suppose Paul had wanted to craft a Human spell caster. Using

his original scores (9.0, 9.7, 6.0, 12.8, 4.3, and 11.6 with a3
Speed, 17 Power and 12 Luck), Paul takes a look at the
Elementalist Mage, which is known for its highly damaging
spells. He knows that having a high Intellect and Insight will

benefit a powerful Mage, so he places the 11.6 in Intellect

and the 12.8 in Insight. Since Elementalists cannot wear armor,
Paul places the 9.7 in Awareness to obtain a DV1 bonus. He

puts the 9.0 in Stamina and receives 18 Hit Points. Lastly, 6.0
is put in Strength and 4.3 in Dexterity. Since Paul’s character

is Human, he receives no racial modifiers to his statistics. As
is usual, Speed, Power and Luck remain constant.
Adding Intellect and Insight, Paul finds he has 24 skill slots.
He considers placing between 10-20 slots into the Magic skill

to gain bonuses to his spell rolls. He decides to go with the

minimum (10) so he can learn a variety of skills. This gives
him no bonuses for his spells but leaves him 14 skill slots to

study other things. After choosing these skills, he eagerly flips
to the Magic section to master the mystical arts ...

Combat is a necessary evil in the world of Forge: Out of Chaos. The following section

describes combat in a step-by-step progression. Both Referees and Players will need to
become familiar with these rules in order to reduce confusion.

Step 1 — The Referee must determine where all combatants (Players and monsters) are in relationship to each other.
Step 2, - Calculate each combatant’s Attack Value (AV) and Defensive
Values (DV1 and DV2). The Players should already have done this
and the numbers should have been recorded on their Character
Sheets. The Referee will need to prepare the monsters. (It is suggested
that most encounters be prepared in advance.)

AV= Weapon Skill Level (WSL) + Dexterity modifier
DVI = Armor Rating (AR) + Shield Rating (SR) + Awareness modifier
DV2 = Armor Rating (AR)
Step 3 - Each combatant must roll 1d6 for initiative. The order of
combat goes from highest to lowest. The order can be made
complicated (but more realistic) by having each person roll individual
initiatives. If you wish to avoid complexity, the Players can roll one

“group” initiative and the Referee can do the same for the monsters.

Rolling group initiatives slightly reduces the sense of realism but
keeps the game moving at a quicker pace.

Step 4 - Once the order of combat is decided, the Referee must
determine the “to hit” value required by the combatants. This is
done by determining the attacker’s AV and the defender’s DV (DV1 or DV2 depending on the circumstances) and consulting
the Combat chart.

Step 5 - Roll a d20 to determine if the attacker successfully hits the target. A result equal to or greater than the score indicated
by the chart is a hit. Any number below the shown score is a miss.
For example, a character with a 5 AV attacks a creature with a6 DV1. Consulting the chart, the Player finds she needs to roll

an 11 “to hit.” If the d20 result is

11 or greater the character hits. If the result is 10 or below, she misses.

When a character successfully hits, the Player determines how much damage is inflicted. The specified damage die (dice) is
rolled and all modifiers (magical spells, skills, Strength modifiers, etc.) are added to the score. The total damage is reported to

the Referee.

For example, a warrior hits with a longsword that inflicts 1d10 damage. The warrior rolls the d10 and the result is 5. She adds

2 points of damage because of her exceptional Strength. She then reports to the Referee that she has inflicted 7 points of

damage to her enemy.

After the Referee subtracts the appropriate damage, the opponent may then attack (if it is still capable of doing so). Again the
Referee should consult the combat chart to calculate the opponent’s “to hit” value. If the character is hit, the Referee determines

the appropriate damage and reports it to the Player.

Keep in mind that as armor absorbs damage, its Defensive Value is reduced. This affects both the DV1 and DV2 of the
combatants. As the values drop, the chance of successfully striking that individual increases.
Once all of the combatants have attacked, the combat minute is over. If the battle is to continue, the combat procedures start
over with Step 1.

42

Combat

Weapon Skill Levels (WSL)
Weapon Skill Level (WSL) is the proficiency a character has
attained with a particular weapon. This is important in
calculating combat values since it helps determine a character’s

chance of successfully striking an opponent. WSL increases

in direct proportion to the frequency of that weapon's use. A
character may learn several weapon skills and levels may differ
dramatically between these weapons. For this reason,
calculating the Attack Value (AV) rating is important for each

weapon. If a character uses a weapon with which he has no
skill, he is considered to have a WSL of 0.

Attack Value (AV)
Attack Value (AV) is a character’s chance of successfully striking

an enemy. It is determined by adding a character’s WSL and

Dexterity modifier, and any other involved bonuses. Skill levels
may vary among weapons, so calculating AVs for every weapon

carried is the best option.

Players deduct actual damage directly from the Hit Points of
their character. The amount of actual damage inflicted is

usually equal to 1 point for each damage die rolled. For

example, a bastard sword inflicting 2d6 damage causes 2 points
of actual damage. A scimitar causes 1 point of actual damage
because it does 1d6+1. In addition, several skills affect the
amount of actual damage inflicted (See Backstabbing and

Assassination).

The remaining damage is absorbed by the character's armor
when applicable (armor damage). Each type of armor has a

set number of Armor Points (AP). These points reflect how
much damage a suit of armor can absorb before being

destroyed. As the Armor Points are reduced, the amount of
protection the armor offers is lowered. If enough damage is
inflicted to destroy a suit of armor, all remaining damage (left
over from an attack or from future attacks) will be deducted
directly from the victim's Hit Points. If the character is not

wearing any armor, all damage suffered must be deducted from
his Hit Points.

For an illustration of how to figure AV, let’s return to our
friend Pic. He has an 11.6 Dexterity, which gives him a +2

For example, a character hits a warrior with a longsword, which

weapon skill. Let’s say he has a2 WSL in mattock. To find his
AV, take his WSL (2) and his Dexterity modifier (+2) and add
them to get an AV of 4. However, if Pic uses a weapon in
which he has no skill, he has a 2 AV (WSL 0 + Dexterity
modifier of +2).

If the warrior is not wearing armor, deduct all 9 points from
Armor Points remaining, the armor would absorb 6 points of

AV modifier. This bonus applies to any weapon despite his

Each weapon has a speed rating based on its size and
encumbrance. This rating determines how many times per
minute the weapon may be used. Some spells may alter this
value. The following chart illustrates the various speed ratings
and how often the weapon may be used in combat situations.

his Hit Points. If the armor worn by the victim had only 6

damage and be destroyed, while the warrior would suffer 3
points of damage to his Hit Points.

Due to the high-powered release of these weapons, the method

for inflicting damage is reversed. Instead of inflicting mostly
armor damage, these weapons do only 1 point of armor damage
per die rolled. Deduct the remaining damage from Hit Points.
Thus, a heavy crossbow inflicts 1 points of armor damage
and the remainder is subtracted ftom the victim’s Hit Points.

Small Weapons — can only be used by races that are man-

sized or smaller, Merikii and characters skilled in Tive Handed
Melee are limited to these weapons when attacking with two
hands.

Medium Weapons — can be used by any race. Characters that

are smaller than man-sized require two hands to wield these
weapons. This means they are unable to use a shield in defense.

Man-sized or larger characters are able to use these weapons

in one hand and may still use shields. Because of their sturdy
frame, Dwarves are able to use these weapons in one hand

and may use a shield as well.

Large Weapons — Due to their size, smaller than man-sized
characters are unable to employ large weapons at all. Mansized and Dwarven characters (because of their sturdy frame)

Weapons and Damage Types
The attacker’s weapon type and Strength modifier determine

damage inflicted on an enemy. Damage falls into two
categories: actual damage and armor damage.

may use large weapons with two hands. Larger than mansized characters still require two hands to wield the weapon
but attack once per combat minute. In addition, they are
allowed to use skills otherwise prohibited with large weapons
(e.g. Final Blow and Parrying).

Missile Weapons

When a character attacks with a bow or thrown weapons (e.g.
spear, javelin, oil flask, etc.), he is employing a missile attack.
The advantage of missile attacks is that the character needs

only to strike his adversary’s DV2, making it easier to hit his
enemy. However, when a character attacks with a missile

weapon, he is unable to defend himself with a shield.

Note that creatures in close proximity to the target (e.g. they
are engaged in melee combat) have a chance of being hit by

an errant missile attack. If the attacker misses with a roll of 2,
3, or 4, he must re-roll to hit one of the creatures in the area.
For multiple targets, roll an appropriate die to determine which
is hit. The re-roll is a considered an Attack Value of 0.

Rolling a “20” or “1” to Hit

Adding the following values determines DV1: Armor Rating
(AR), Shield Rating (SR), and Awareness modifiers. The higher
a character’s DV1 rating, the harder he is to hit.

When fighting more than one melee enemy, the Prime

Opponent (the enemy the character attacks) strikes against
the character’s DV1, while all remaining opponents attack

against his DV2. Since a character is unable to adequately
defend against multiple attacks, only the Armor Rating (AR)
is used to calculate the target’s DV2. Any melee combatant

may be designated as the Prime Opponent, but the Player
must specify which creature he attacks prior to rolling dice.

The character may choose to attack a different opponent at
any time, but must state his intention to the Referee. All
adversaries other than the Prime Opponent attack the
character’s DV2. Some skills focus on enhancing defensive
ability against multiple foes (see Parrying and Tactics).

During melee combat, an attacker must roll a d20 to hit her

enemy. Whenever a natural “20” is rolled, the character
automatically hits the opponent and causes additional damage.

The damage inflicted is deducted from both the enemy’s armor

and Hit Points, rather than dividing it between the two. For
example, a longsword inflicts 1d10 points of damage. The
character rolls a 7. Normally, it would inflict 1 point of damage
to the target’s Hit Points and 6 points to its armor. If the

character rolled a “20” on his attack roll, he inflicts 7 points

of Hit Point damage and 7 points of armor damage! If the
target were not wearing any armor, the character would inflict
14 points of damage directly to the victim's Hit Points.

One drawback to rolling a natural “20” is that it causes physical
damage to the weapon. Such damage is recorded as a “notch.”

Each weapon can sustain a certain number of notches before
breaking (see Weapons chart). A skilled laborer may repair a
weapon before it breaks, but once it sustains its maximum
number of notches, the weapon cannot be mended.
When a Player rolls a “1” on his d20 in combat, the character
misses the target and drops his weapon. The character can
retrieve the weapon without penalty unless an enemy

successfully employs the Weapon Stomp skill.

Rolling a “1” when employing a bow results in an automatic
miss and the weapon's string snaps. If the character is carrying
replacement strings, he can use the weapon the following
combat minute without penalty. If no extra strings are
available, the weapon becomes useless.
If a character rolls a “1” when throwing an oil flask, he must

roll 1d100. A result equal to 05% or less indicates he spilled

Armor
Armor provides protection from many kinds of damaging
attacks (e.g. missile, melee, spell). Each type of armor has an
Armor Rating (AR) that enhances the Defensive Values of the

wearer (both DV1 and DV2). This determines how easily a

character can be hit. In addition to protecting the wearer,
armor absorbs damage. Each suit of armor has a distinct
number of Armor Points. As the wearer incurs damage, a
portion of the damage is deducted from the character's Hit
Points, while her armor absorbs the remainder. As Armor
Points are subtracted, the protection a suit of armor offers is
lowered until it is destroyed. To find a suit of armor’s current
AR, check its remaining Armor Points against the chart below.
Armor Points may be repaired by using the Field Repair skill
or by askilled Armorer. Until repairs are completed, however,
the armor provides an Armor Rating based upon its remaining
Armor Points. For example, a brand new suit of leather armor
has 20 Armor Points and offers an Armor Rating of 2. During
combat, an opponent inflicts sufficient damage to reduce the

leather armor to 8 Armor Points. Consulting the chart you

discover that your AR is reduced to 1. It will remain a 1 until
repairs are made. If the suit of armor is reduced to 0 AP, no
repairs are possible and the armor has been destroyed. Once

armor is destroyed, all additional damage the wearer suffers is
deducted directly from his Hit Points.

Each type of armor has a maximum number ofArmor Points
and may never exceed this score.
Armor Points (AP)

burning oil on himself and suffers 1d6 points of actual damage.

Defensive Values
Combatants have two types of Defensive Values. These values
are used to determine if a character or monster is damaged in
combat situations. The primary Defensive Value (DV1) is used
against the Prime Opponent. The secondary Defensive Value
(DV2) is used when the character is attacked from the side,
behind, or via a missile weapon.

Field Repair skill cannot repair damage done to a shield. Only
never exceed its maximum Shield Point value.

When damage is inflicted on the character’s DV1, the Player

has the option to deduct the points from the character’s shield
instead ofhis armor. Each type ofshield may take an amount
of damage equal to its Shield Points (SP). Ifa shield is reduced

to 0 Shield Points it is destroyed and may not be repaired.

Like armor, as Shield Points are reduced, the protection it
offers is decreased. To find a shield’s current SR, check its

remaining Shield Points against the chart below.

Healing
There are four ways to restore lost Hit Points. The most
common method is through sleeping. Each time a character

sleeps continuously for 8 hours, he regains 1 Hit Point. Another

way of mending wounds is through the consumption of
healing roots, which automatically cure 1d4 Hit Points.

Magical spells or items may also heal wounds.
The fourth manner of restoration is the use of Binding skill,

SHIELD Points (SP)

SHIELD RATING (SR)

which allows the binder to administer first aid to the wounded.
This requires the use of a binding kit (a packet of sterilized
cloth, thread, and needles). Each successful application ofa
binding kit cures 3 Hit Points worth of damage. Note that

binding does not cure damage sustained internally (e.g.
poison, spores, Harpy’s song).

There are no methods of healing that can place a character
above his maximum Hit Point value. The only way to increase
a character’s maximuin Hit Points is by increasing his Stamina
characteristic, either through skill selection or magical means.

Sample Combat Situations
One on One Combat

We are now going to run through a full combat session to get
a better “feel” for how it works. For this demonstration, let’s
return to Paul’s Ghantu warrior, Pic. Pic, a big, burly brute,

has been confronted by a Human thief named Kameron (for
simplicity sake, let’s say that Kameron is not too bright!) The

Ill. This combat minute has ended. Now it is time for the
warriors to recalculate their Combat Ratings.
Pic suffered no damage so his values remain the same.
Kameron lost 10 points of armor, so his DV1 and DV2 drop
by 1. Pic now only needs a 13 or better to hit him.

following is a description of the combat and the method for
calculating combat values, attacks, and damages.

Pic is an exceptionally strong Ghantu who wears leather armor

(2 AR). He wields a mattock (1 WSL). His Dexterity (11.6)
gives him a +2 AV and an Awareness (9.0) modifier gives him

a +1 to his DV1. In addition, he has the racial benefit of Thick

Hides that increases his Armor Rating by 1.

Combat Minute #2

I. Rolling initiative, Pic rolls a 6 while Kameron only rolls a
1. This means that Pic goes first.
Il. Eagerly rolling his d20, Pic rolls a 9 and misses (he needs
a 13 or better).
Kameron is now able to attack and rolls a natural “1” on his
d20. He drops his weapon! Normally, he could retrieve the

Kameron, an average Human, wears ring armor (4 AR) and
carries a large shield (2 SR). He uses a scimitar (1 WSL). In

weapon (0 WSL). He has no Dexterity modifier but his
Awareness of 9.3 gives him a +1 to his DV1.

12% - Success! Not only does Pic receive a credit toward

addition, he carries a mace but doesn’t have any skill in the

Weapon Stomp skill. Pic's percentage base in the skill is 20%.
He opts to use the skill and rolls his percentile dice, scoring a
Weapon Stomp advancement, he places his booted foot on
Kameron’s weapon and stops him from retrieving it. Both
combatants have finished their attacks and will continue to
fight.
III. Now it is time to figure out the combatant's Combat
Ratings again.
Pic is still uninjured so his Combat Ratings remain the same.

Again, Kameron’s ratings change. He dropped. his weapon
Combat Minute #1:

his new Attack Value. Since he does not have the same WSL

dG initiative to decide the order of attack. Kameron rolls a5
and Pic rolls a 3. Kameron goes first!

Il. Kameron rolls a d20 to attack and scores a 5. To see if he
successfully hit, take Kameron’s AV (1) and Pic’s DV1 (4) and
consult the Combat Chart. By following the chart, Kameron
needs a 13 or better to hit. Since he rolled a 5, he misses.

Now, Pic gets to attack. He rolls a 16 on a d20. Using Pic’s AV
(3) and Kameron’s DV1 (7), the chart shows that Pic needs a
14 or better to hit. Since his number is higher than 14, Pic
hits and inflicts 2d6 damage. He rolls the dice and scores an
8. Due to his exceptional Strength, Pic adds +4 to his damage,

bringing the total to 12 points. Two points of damage are
subtracted from Kameron’s Hit Points while 10 points are
subtracted from his armor. Since the thief’s armor falls below

31 points, his AR is reduced to 3. Since Pic successfully hit,

Combat Minute #3
1. Again the combatants roll their initiative dice. This time
Kameron wins and goes first.

II. Rolling his d20, Kameron rolls a 13. However, since his

Attack Value was reduced to 0, he needs to roll a 14 or better
and misses (0 AV verses a4 DV1).

he receives one credit toward his Mattock skill advancement.

Combat

Now Pic goes. His d20 roll scores a natural “20”. He rolls his
2d6 to find out how much damage he inflicts and scores a 10.

Due to his exceptional Strength, this damage is increased by
+4, totaling 14. Since Pic rolled a “20,” he inflicts 14 points

of damage to both Kameron’s Hit Points and armor.

Since Kameron only has a 6.2 Stamina, his maximum Hit
Points are 12. Pic inflicted enough damage to knock Kameron
into negative Hit Points. The thief falls unconscious. Pic gains
a credit toward Weapon skill advancement for his successful
hit in combat and sustains a notch on his weapon due to the
natural “20.”

Two on One Combat
This time we will run through an encounter with more than
two combatants. In this example, our lovable hero, Pic, is

engaged with two Human bandits (Kameron’s really mean
older brothers).

Pic has the same characteristics, weapons, and armor as he
did in the previous battle. His combat values are as follows:

and gathers what treasure he can find.

The bandits are both wearing studded leather armor (3 AR)
and carry small shields (1 SR). They wield scimitars and are
each 2nd level (2 WSL). Neither one has a Strength, Dexterity
or Awareness modifier.

III. The combat minute has ended, so we must find out our
combatants’ Combat Ratings.
Pic sustained enough damage to lower his Armor Rating. His

new values are as follows.

Bandit #1 suffered enough damage to lower his Armor Rating.
This affects both his DV1 and DV2.

means Bandit #1 attacks first, Pic attacks second, and the other

Combat Minute #2

Pic rolls a 3, Bandit #1 rolls a 6 and the other rolls a 2. This

bandit swings third.

Il. Bandit #1 chooses Pic as his Prime Opponent and the
Ghancu chooses him. This means Bandit #1 must strike Pic’s
DV1. Rolling his d20, the bandit scores a 16. Consulting the
combat table, a 2 AV attacking a 4 DV1 needs a 12 or better.
The bandit hit! Wielding a scimitar, the bandit inflicts 2-7

points of damage (1d6+1). He rolls a total of 6 points. Pic
must deduct 1 point from his Hit Points and 5 points for his
armor.
Pic can now swing at Bandit #1, his Prime Opponent, and
rolls a 19. That is a hit and the Ghantu records his credit
toward his weapon advancement. Rolling his 2d6 for damage,
he rolls a 10. His Strength gives him +4 making the total
damage inflicted 14 points. ‘Two points are deducted from
the bandit’s Hit Points while the other 12 are subtracted from
its armor. This brings his Armor Points down from 30 to 18,
lowering his Armor Rating.

I. Rolling initiative, Pic scores a 6 and goes first. Bandit #2
attacks second and the Bandit #1 goes third!

II. Swinging his mattock, the Ghantu scores a 15. Another
hit! He records his credit toward weapon advancement and
rolls his 2d6 for damage. The score is a 4 which, added to his
Strength modifier (+4), results in 8 points. Bandic #1 suffers
2 points to his Hit Points and deducts the other G points from
his shield, lowering his Shield Points from 10 to 4.
Bandit #2 goes next. He rolls a 19 on his d20 and hits. The
damage he inflicts is equal to 4. Pic subtracts | from Hit Points

and the other 3 points he deducts from his armor.
Aclast, Bandit #1 swings and rolls a natural “20”. Pic is hurting
now! The bandit rolls 6 points of damage, which must be

deducted from both the Ghantu’s armor and Hit Points. His
armor had 6 Armor Points remaining. It has been destroyed.

opportunity to flee!

II. Throwing his backpack to the ground, Pic retreats into the

forest at his full movement rate.

The bandits opt to stay and pick over the backpack rather
than chase him through the woods. They are content that
they got the Ghantu’s treasure and will wait to waylay the
next traveler. Greedily, they open the pack and find that they
are holding a pack full of rations. They fell for the bait!
Pic returns to the village and purchases new equipment.

Although he is a strong warrior, he learned one very important

lesson. Fighting two enemies is much harder than fighting a

Bandit #2 rolls his d20 and scores a 14. A hit! The damage die
shows that Pic sustains 6 points. He subtracts 6 from his Hit
Points. This reduces the Ghantu’s Hit Points to 1.

Pic realizes he is outmatched and decides to flee. He uses his
combat minute to turn around and run away. However, a
new initiative must be rolled before Pic escapes. If the bandits
win, they will get another attack at him as he leaves. If he
wins, he will escape. But will they pursue?
II. Again the Combat Ratings must be determined.
Pic’s Combat Values have not changed.

A Note on Miniatures

If you wish to use minatures (metal figures, counters,

etc.) to help envision the combat scenario please feel

free! Sometimes this will help in realizing the distances

between characters and monsters. However, if you

do not wish have such icons, you can draw it on paper
(the old “football” diagram with Xs and Os) or just

imagine it in your head. The problem with this last
option is that the Referee and each Player may have a
different vision of what the combat looks like.

Bandit #1 was not injured that combat minute. His values
will remain the same.

Bandit #2 is still untouched. His values remain the same.

REFEREE’S GUIDE

Gawes

The Referee plays the most important role in the gaming session. It is the Referee who
runs the adventure and is responsible for setting the scene in which the Players interact.

You can play adventures found in modules, or you can exercise your imagination to create

your own adventures.

As the Referee, you play the “bad guy.” That is, you play the role of the monsters, Non-Player Characters (NPCs), and
anything else that interacts with the Players’ characters. You make the rolls (initiative, attacks, damage, etc.), keep track of the

Hit Points and Attack Values, and plan the strategy of any creatures the Players may encounter. Other common tasks include
keeping track of the party's location on the dungeon map and figuring out when a trap has been sprung (and its effects).

In short, the Referee is the gaming judge. Like a courtroom judge, the Referee must rely on the rules and his own sense of
fairness when presiding over an adventure.
If the Referee is creative and involves all the Players in an exciting, fast-paced adventure, the chances are the gaming session will
be a success. On the other hand, if the Referee lets the game get out of control, it’s probably going to be a long night.

The following tips can be used by beginning Referees to aid them in making the adventure the most enjoyable it can be:

Be prepared.

The Scouts’ motto applies to gaming as well. Always be sure to read over an adventure before trying to play it. Study the
material so that only the Players’ characters are surprised by what’s behind that locked iron door. If the adventure calls for a
monster with which you are not familiar, be sure to read over that monster’s description before you play. Ifit helps, make notes
on index cards and color code them with sections of your map, so you'll know that there is a hidden pit infested with poisonous
snakes in front of the jewel-encrusted throne. Don’t let all the work you put into crafting an adventure go for naught because
youre not prepared,
Helpful Hints
Use a book or two to construct a screen for hiding your maps, notes, etc. Three ring binders work great for this purpose!

Have each Player write their character’s statistics and possessions on an index card and submit them to you at the beginning of
cach gaming session. That way, when the party is traveling through a bustling city street and a pickpocket successfully filches
a pouch, you don’t have to tip off the victim by asking the character where the enchanted dagger is hidden.
Keep a towel or rag behind the Referee screen so that when a secret roll has to be made you don’t alert the Players.

S

RS

Compile a list of names and quick descriptions of the Non-Player Characters. You never know when a party will ask the night
watchman at the city gates for his name. “Bob” just doesn’t seem to cut it, if that’s the first name that jumps into your head.

Be Creative.

Let your imagination run wild! The adventure does not stop after you have written it. Make sure you save some of that
creativity for the gaming session.
Helpful Hints

Don't be afraid to speak in different voices. If the Player is talking to a Ghantu warrior, speak with a gruff, deep voice using
one-syllable words. On the contrary, if the Player encounters a noble, speak with a haughty air using words only an intellectual

would understand (Be sure to keep your nose in the air!).

Create interesting Non-Player Characters. Give them motivation for the things they do. Give them desires and fears just like
you would a Player character. In short, try to make them seem like real people. Be careful, however, not to fall into a rut and
make too many similar Non-Player Characters, where every NPC is motivated by money and will sell his sister for a gold coin!

Know when to bend the rules.

Perhaps the most difficult aspect of Refereeing a fantasy adventure is knowing when to bend the rules. It really isn’t any fun
when the Referee spends hours working up the perfect adventure only to have the characters decimated in the second room
visited. “Cheating” is an option only if the “bent” rule doesn’t drastically alter the spirit of the adventure. For example, if a
character uses his last drop of healing potion on a person that is at -4 Hit Points and you roll a 3, you probably won't ruin the
game by telling the Player he got back 4 Hit Points. This way he is unconscious at zero (and not hemorrhaging toward certain

death). Conversely, you are only cheating yourself if you allow a party of adventurers to stroll into a Dragon's lair and falsely

defeat the beast and inherit its horde of powerful magic items. Remember that adventuring is dangerous; characters can die.

desk. This could potentially ruin the perfect scenario you had

If you allow a character to falsely “heal” lost Hit Points (as in

the above example), don’t be afraid to add a little extra damage
in the next combat to balance the game.

Involve all the Players in your adventure.

Invariably in the group setting, one or two Players emerge as
the leaders and dominant characters. Don’t fall into the trap
of interacting with only these characters. Make sure you involve
all the Players, especially the newcomers who may feel unsure
of themselves in the Forge: Out of Chaos system.
Helpful Hints

Tailor a special item or an adventure scenario around a Player
who seems lost in the crowd. Give the Player a reason to feel
special about their character.

Referee Checklist

So, you are lucky enough to be the Referee for the game. The
first thing you should do is read through the rules and
familiarize yourself with the game's mechanics. This is very
important! It is difficult to run an enjoyable game if you have
to consult the rules every time someone asks you a question.
In addition to reading
the rulebook, here is a
helpful checklist to

make sure you are
prepared for your
gaming night. Keep in

mind that it is your job

to develop the scenario

and guide the Players.
If you are not properly
prepared, it will show.

Develop a Scenario — This means that you have something
ready for the Players to explore or do. It can be as simple as a
small cavern complex inhabited by wolves. It does not have to
extravagant, but you should know what monsters, treasures,
traps, and dangers are present. It is not a good idea to make

things up as you go along. This tends to make things disjointed
and detracts from the quality of the adventure.

Prepare your NPCs — During the course of an adventure,
the Players’ characters will communicate with NPCs (Non-

Player Characters). The Referee creates these people and talks

for them. Some of these people will be important to the game.
Since it is your scenario, you know which ones the characters
will talk with. You should put some real thought into these

people and develop their personalities.

notes! It is no fun arriving at your friend’s house on a gaming
night and realizing you left some vital campaign notes on your
been planning for months, or it could delay gaming while

you run back home and get them. Either way, it is something
to avoid!
Bring your Supplies — The Referee should bring a few

items with him to any gaming session. First, he should carry
one or two three-ring notebooks to use as a screen. If the
Players can read your notes, there is not going to be much
surprise to the game. You may want to bring a rag or towel.

Whenever you want to make a secret roll (one you don’t want

the Players to know about), roll it on the towel so that no one
will hear it. You should also bring some graph paper (for
mapping), a pen or pencil, and a tablet of scratch paper.
Now that you have prepared the adventure, created your

NPCs, organized your notes, and gathered your gaming gear,
you are ready for an exciting night of gaming. Just relax and
let the adventure begin.

NPC Guide

The adventuring party walks into the Boars Head Tavern and

takes a seat at a table. Although they had expected to see dozens of
tavern patrons, afew soldiersfrom the nearby outpost, andpossibly
some serving wenches and bar hands, the Referee had notprepared
his list ofNon-Player Characters (NPCs) and so the tavern stands
empty. Unable to get some ale, they leave the establishment,
grumbling and bitter.

Non-Player Characters (NPCs) are generated by the Referee
to give a sense of realism to the campaign. They can vary
from stable hands and thieves to beggars and kings. Each
character should have its own unique personality and
motivations. Like normal characters, they have characteristics
and skills, money and supplies. Generating a list of hundreds
of pre-designed NPCs described down to individual tattoos
and birthmarks is not essential, but it is a good idea to have
names and general notes on the more significant personages
the characters will encounter.
NPCs have a variety of tasks. First, some exist only to help
the characters. These characters could be bartenders who give
rumors of fallen castles, airs, etc., store owners that sell rations
and armor to the adventuring band, or even street urchins
that give Players directions to local taverns and businesses.
Although probably not very important characters, these types
of NPCs make up most of a Referee’s world. Since they are
not going to play a significant role in the game, the Referee
need only know their names and general appearances. Keep
careful track of the places where they are encountered, for
Players might choose to return and talk with them again.

Referee’s Guide

53

Some NPCs exist to bring woe to the characters. These people

are typically thieves that attempt to rob the Players. However,
they can be less conspicuous. Some NPCs are jewelers who
wrongly appraise gems and other valuable items and buy them
for a lower cost. Some are magistrates who charge the visiting

characters with a crime and then agree to drop the charges for

a handful of gold coins. Since these NPCs offer difficult times

to the Players, expect their characters to retaliate. Having the

characteristics and general attitudes of these NPCs on hand
is, therefore, quite important. In addition, the NPCs may

expect the Players to get mad (and possibly hostile), and might

have contingencies for such situations. Keep in mind that most
NPCs are not out to get the characters. A balance needs to be

maintained if the Players and Referee are going to enjoy the

gaming session.

Remembering that the Players are adventuring througha living

world is important. Look around you and see all the different
types of personalities that exist in the modern day. Attempt to
bring that realism into the gaming sessions. If everyone is

pleasant and happy, smothering the characters with milk and
cookies, it will not be a very enjoyable gaming session (well, it
may be for the Players at first, but even they will get tired of
it). Instead, make the Players think and interact with the NPCs

they meet. Force them to stay on their toes when dealing with
merchants, who might rob them blind with high prices, or
thugs who can cause trouble. Remember, though, that the

dungeon or other scenario that you have created takes

precedence. You don’t want quarreling with NPCs to distract
from the actual adventure at hand. You worked too hard to

have the gaming night ruined by petty disputes.

|

Another form of NPC is an adventurer. This type of NPC
can be found almost anywhere. They can travel in small groups
or by themselves. At times they will post their names and
skills on bulletin boards seeking employment or approach the
Players in taverns. Some of these adventurers may ask to join
the characters’ group, offering their skills or abilities in
exchange for treasure. These NPCs will have a great influence
on the game if they are hired. The Referee should have them
completely written up from characteristics and personality to
skills and equipment. Payment for their services can vary from

a monthly contract of gold coins to an actual share of the
treasure. The more skilled and powerful the NPC is, the more
treasure he will require. In addition, some NPCs will not travel
with the characters unless they receive some magical items
that are found on the journey. Note that not all NPCs that
are hired will be completely loyal to the Players. Some may
attempt to steal treasure on the journey, others may run from
combat situations that are going bad. Still, more may
constantly argue about marching orders or sleeping
arrangements, failing to concentrate on matters at hand.

Reaction Rolls
Late one evening, a band of road-weary adventurers stumbles
into the crowded common room ofa high-class inn. A reaction
roll determines how the various patrons receive them. The
Referee should roll percentile dice each time a character begins
talking with a Non-Player Character (NPC) and consult the
following table. Racial detriments and prejudices will modify
the score. It is up to the Referee to decide the amount of

penalty or bonus the character receives based on the situation.

di00
Rout

REACTION

Typically, a character can travel 20 miles per day over even

terrain (plains, flatlands, etc.). When traveling over hills or
through dense forests, this movement is reduced to 15 miles.

Swamps and tangled jungles affect traveling even more

dramatically. Attempting to move through these areas,
characters have a maximum rate of ten miles per day. The
most difficult region to travel, however, is mountainous, rocky
terrain. Characters moving through this type of region can
only achieve a speed of five miles per day.
The Referee should keep in mind the distances the characters
must travel because it works hand in hand with time. The

longer a person travels, the more food he requires, the more
time passes, and the more the world around him changes.

Time
‘Time is an important aspect of the game. The Referee should
keep careful track of its passing. Like real people, characters
require food and water to survive. Don't let them travel for
months on a single week of rations. Also, characters heal
wounds over time (typically 1 Hit Point per night of rest).
Even though it will take some time, characters will eventually
grow old and must retire from the adventuring life.

Time affects more than just the characters. The world around
them changes from day to day. Because of this, the Players
must choose carefully what adventures their characters

undertake. A lot can happen while you are out wandering in
the wilderness.

Time is also important in other situations. Each minute, all
combatants are able to perform their attacks. A wizard can
cast one spell (except Enchanters, who require a great deal of
time). A character that is knocked into negative Hit Points

will suffer damage due to blood loss. Spells, magical abilities,

and the beneficial effects of certain roots have a distinct
duration. If you don’t keep track of time, you will not know
when these effects end.

Vision

Increasing or decreasing the reaction rating that a character

has with an NPC through actions is an option. Repeatedly

taking advantage of a kind and generous person will eventually
damage the relationship and lower the NPC’s reaction toward
the character. Likewise, performing actions that benefit the

NPC may positively change the reaction rating.

Traveling
Traveling is very important, as characters must travel to every

dungeon they want to explore. Moving about a campaign

world, characters are forced to move through different terrain.
Because of this, the Referee must know how long it will take
to make a journey. With this information, the characters can

better plan to buy their food and provisions.

As two Humans cautiously walk down the dungeon corridor, their
torch begins to waver. Ahead ofthem they hear the vicious snarls
of some massive creature and they draw their weapons in
preparation for the coming battle. Slowly they continue, and as
they approach the monster, their torch goes out and darkness
consumes them. Unable to see, their screams echo through the
corridors as the hungry beast devours them.

Vision is an important aspect of Forge: Out of Chaos. There
are four distinct types of vision available: Normal, Heat, Night,
and Undead. Although each race has Normal vision, some
possess a second form as well. When appropriate lighting

conditions exist, the character's eyes will adjust automatically

and enable the character to see accordingly. Although each
race also has a standard sight range, this range can be modified

by appropriate racial benefits and detriments. In addition,

some magical spells affect the type and/or range of the
character’s vision.

Referee’s Guide

55

Normal Vision requires a light source to see in darkness.

Without light, a character will find it difficult to maneuver in
dungeon settings and almost impossible to fight (see Blind

Fighting). When outdoors at night, a character can see, though
the range can be dramatically lowered depending on the

intensity of the moonlight. The Referee should feel free to

limit the sight by 1/2 to 1/4 the range, depending on

conditions. When outdoors in daylight, a character can see as
far as normal conditions allow. The real detriment to Normal
vision is when traveling underground, in dungeons or other
dark areas. A character can only see what is illuminated via
torch, lantern, spell, etc. The range of sight is equal to the
illumination source present (i.e. a torch gives off illumination
in a 15' diameter, a lantern illuminates a 30' diameter, etc.).
Heat Vision works best in underground settings when a
light source is unavailable. Characters with this sight can see

Mapping

Mapping is essential to any form of dungeon exploration. It
aids the Players in visualizing their surroundings. It enables
them to see clearly where they have been and where they need
to explore. Without maps, characters may wander aimlessly
down the same corridors. This can be very frustrating for the
Players and for the Referee as well. Also, Players that keep
clear and precise maps may find it easier to pinpoint the most
likely places for secret doors and passages.
Mapping should be done on a sheet of graph paper. Each
square typically represents a 10' x 10' section, whether it be a
hallway or a room. When mapping, the Referee should tell
the party leader (or the person mapping) what he or she sees
in the direction the character is facing. It is important to note
that the character can only see as far as his illumination extends.

enables the character to see his maximum range of sight,
providing there is a small amount of illumination available.
When outdoors at night, this type of sight allows a character

to see with relative ease, since the moonlight always provides
enough light to amplify. When underground or in dark areas,

however, he would lose his benefits of Night Vision if a light
source were not present. For example, a Dunnar who has Night
vision with a range of 60' is carrying a torch that illuminates

only a 15' sphere. Since his eyesight amplifies the light source,

he can see the entire 60' distance. If he had no light source, he
would be as blind as a character with Normal Vision.

Undead Vision enables a character to see normally despite
conditions. They can see in heavily illuminated areas, dimly
lit areas, even in utter darkness. Regardless of the
circumstances, the sight range of the monster is always static
even if sources of illumination warrant a longer range.

Keep in mind that secret doors are not readily seen and must

be discovered. As one becomes more familiar with the concept
of mapping, the task becomes easier.
The Referee can elect to map the dungeon for the Players

while they choose the direction they will travel. However, it is

much more interesting, enjoyable, and entertaining to let the
Players map (or mis-map) for themselves.

Illumination
Light is a consideration in any type of exploration. In an

outdoor adventure, you need a light source at night to see

creatures that may approach your campsite. A campfire may
even serve to ward off some animals such as a pack of hungry
Wolves. Of course, it might also attract a curious Ogre or
two,

In a dungeon setting, light is even more important. Without
alight source (e.g. torch, lantern) your group cannot function
very well. The group cannot map, will fail to find secret doors,
will wall into walls, fall into pits, and monsters that see in the
dark will eat you. Before you spend those last few gold coins

ona round of ales at a local tavern, make sure you purchase a
tinderbox and a few torches.

Breaking Open Portals

Treasure is not usually found lying about the dungeon floor.

Most times it is hidden behind a locked, stuck or barred door,

gate or other troublesome portal. Since no worthwhile

adventurer is going to let a door stand between him and untold
riches, this section describes the portals one can encounter on

an adventure and the methods for breaking them open.

There are several types of portals that can be found. These
are: stuck doors, locked doors, barred doors, iron-reinforced
doors, and portcullises. Each one possesses a number of
structural points that determine the damage it can sustain
before opening. A character can inflict structural damage with

his strength or by using a weapon such as a hammer or axe.

Of course there are some portals which open quite nicely and
with little effort, but these rarely lead to mountains of treasure.
The following is a description of the troublesome (yet often

profitable) portals, the structural points they possess, and the

methods one can use to open them.

Stuck Door — (1d6 structural points) is the most common
form of portal. Since dungeons are often damp, a typical
wooden door swells within its framework to a point that it
cannot be opened. A character is able to hit a stuck door with
his shoulder. This attack inflicts 1d2 points of structural
damage for every 6 full points of Strength the character

possesses. Once sufficient damage is inflicted, the door opens.

Locked Door — (1d6+4 structural points) is not as easy to

open as a stuck door. There are three methods that can be

Iron-Reinforced Door —- (10+2d10 structural points)
cannot be opened without a hammer. Since the door is secured
from the other side, using the Open Locks skill has no effect.
Furthermore, a character has no chance of breaking it open
with his strength. Even axes prove ineffective due to the iron
bands that reinforce the door. Only a hammer (hand, war, or
maul) can open the door. A normal hammer inflicts 1 point
of structural damage per attack. A war hammer causes 1d2
points of structural damage per minute. While the maul
delivers 1d2+2 points of damage. Once sufficient damage is
inflicted, the door opens.

used to gain entrance to this type of portal without the

appropriate key. The easiest is by using the Open Locks skill.

The next method is for the character to strike the door with

his shoulder. Because the door is firmly secured, only
exceptionally strong characters are able to break it open. For
every full point of Strength above 9, the character inflicts 1

point of structural damage per attack. The last method for
opening a locked door is through the use of an axe (hand,
battle, or mattock) or hammer (hand, war, or maul). A hand

axe or hammer inflicts | point of structural points per minute.

A battleaxe or war hammer causes 1d2 points of structural
damage per minute. The mattock or maul delivers 1d2+2
points of structural damage per attack. Once sufficient damage
is inflicted, the door shatters and no longer serves as a barrier.
Barred Door — (10+1d10 structural points) is almost
impossible to break down without a weapon. Since it is secured
from the opposite side, using the Open Locks skill has no effect.

Only characters that possess a Strength score greater than 13.0

have a chance of inflicting damage. Each minute they strike
the portal they have a 25% chance of causing 1 point of

structural damage. The only other option is to use an axe or
hammer. A hand axe or hammer inflicts 1 point of structural

points per minute. A battleaxe or war hammer causes 1d2
points of structural damage per minute. While the mattock
or maul delivers 1d2+2 points of structural damage per attack.
Once sufficient damage is inflicted, the door is shattered.

Portcullises — cannot be broken. Instead, only strength can

lift these massive iron gates. Up to three characters can work
together at this task that typically requires a combined Strength
score of 25. If the characters do not possess such strength,
opening the portal is impossible. Most portcullises have a
locking device to keep them open and a wheel that can be

turned to raise and lower it. However, these devices are typically
located on the side the adventurers are trying to reach.
When attempting to break down doors, whether with sheer
strength or by using weapons, the action makes a great deal of

noise. This can attract monsters! Every minute a character

attacks a door, the Referee should roll 1d6 to determine if the
noise alerts a monster. If the score is a 6, the Referee should
have a wandering monster attack. Sometimes, depending on
the circumstances, more than one number can indicate an

encounter. For example, attempting to break down a door in

a king’s palace might alert guards on a roll of 2 or better.

As you prepare to go adventuring, make sure you purchase an
axe and a hammer. Not only can you use them in combat but
you can also break down a few doors and find loads of treasure.

Just remember to watch your back. Who knows what nasty
beastie will be attracted by the noise?

Falling from any height greater than 10' results in physical

Characters can avoid taking damage from minor falls by using
the Tumbling skill.

Gaze Evasion
Characters fighting certain monstets may opt to avert their

eyes from the monster's gaze. Although this might protect the

character from the deadly gaze of a Cavasha, Hag, or Medusa,
it is not foolproof. Gaze Evasion adversely affects the character’s
ability to fight. While averting one’s gaze, the character suffers

skill and some spells (e.g. Wind Vigil, Undead Sight) give a

character the ability to detect hidden creatures and thus avid

surprise.

Once an enemy is detected, the surprise is instantly lost and
all benefits are negated.

may learn the Mounted Combat Melee and/or Mounted Combat

When a character standing on the ground is forced to fight a
mounted adversary, he suffers a -2 AV penalty because of the
difficulty associated with attacking upward. The boar spear,
flail, bastard sword and two-handed sword, however, were
specifically made for this purpose. When one of these weapons
are used, the -2 AV penalty is negated.
It must be noted! Attempting to fight while mounted without
sufficient training (c.g. the LJorsemeanship skill) is difficult and
can be dangerous. At the beginning of each combat minute,
before the initiatives are rolled, there is a 50% chance that a

character will fall from his saddle. Falling inflicts 1d2 points
of damage and stuns the rider for the remainder of that combat

minute.

Blind Fighting

Characters that are blind (whether by monsters, spells, or lack
of illumination) suffer offensive and defensive penalties. First,
all attacks are made on their DV2 since they cannot see to
defend themselves. Second, they suffer a -10 to their Attack

Value. The only way to lessen this AV penalty is by using the
Blind Fighting skill. This proficiency allows a character to use
other senses (hearing, smell, etc.) to help in combat situations.

Although this allows characters to fight more effectively, attacks

are still made against their DV2. For example, a Cavasha blinds
a warrior during the first combat minute. During the rest of
the fight, the warrior suffers a -10 AV and the creature can
attack its DV2. If the character had been skilled in Blind

Fighting, the Attack Value modifier may have only been -7.

However, the creature would still attack the warriors DV2.

Running

There are times when a character might be forced to run from
combat.When this occurs, the character’s Speed value and
Stamina score becomes very important. A character is able to
run his full movement rate determined by his Speed for three
minutes for each full point of Stamina he possesses. Once this
maximum time elapses, the character must spend 30 minutes

resting.

If a character is proficient in the Running skill, he is able to
run up to ten minutes for each full point of Stamina he
possesses. In addition, since the character can control his
breathing, he only requires 10 minutes of rest after completing
his run.
Characters that are forced to fight while resting receive a -1
Attack Value due to exhaustion,

Water Melee:
Combat in or under Water

The adventurers look across the river at the ving offallen stones.
They had heard rumors that this was the site ofthe ancient tower.
Eager to explore its debris, they send one of their members across
the slow moving water with a grappling hook and some rope. The
Human, who is skilled in Swimming, dives in and begins to cross
the river as his comrades wait eagerly for him to reach the stones.
Suddenly, he begins shouting. Several Gelebs, a race of aquatic
humanoids, break the surface of the water. Two of them attack
the lone swimmer, who beginsflailing about with his short sword
while the others move toward the group on land.
Characters may find themselves forced to fight while
submerged partially or fully in water. Combat in water is vastly

different from combat on land. Because of this, a character
receives a -4 AV penalty. The damage he inflicts is reduced by

3 points. Movement is also affected. When moving through

water (walking, swimming, etc.) the movement speed of the
character is reduced to 1/4. Characters skilled in the Swimming
skill suffer fewer penalties because of their training.

‘Treasure
The term “treasure” refers to any item of value found while
adventuring, from a fist-sized gem to a suit of armor. The
most commonly found treasure is gold and/or silver coins.

Occasionally, a group of adventurers may even come across
gems, pieces of fine jewelry including rings, necklaces, and an

exquisite tapestry or two. The discretion of the Referee

determines what a group of explorers might find. The rewards

should not heavily outweigh the challenges.

Adventuring is an expensive business. The Forge: Out ofChaos
system is designed to limit the amount of disposable income
a group of adventurers may accrue. Adventurers may need to
repair armor and weapons, purchase spell components, of

obtain healing supplies such as healing roots and binding kits.

The rewards of adventuring surpass simple monetary treasures.
With adventure brings experience! As they travel about the
world, characters will grow in knowledge, possibly learn new
skills, and increase each skill’s percentage base. After
experiencing several campaigns, characters will become more

powerful and maybe even a little wealthier.

When a character is first generated, he starts with money to
buy weapons, armor, spell components, and other equipment.
Although the Referee should feel free to set a limit on how
much gold a character begins with, in most campaigns it is
best calculated by rolling 3d6 and multiplying the result by
10 (30 to 180 gold coins).

Magical Items:
Types and Creation

Enchanters are known to bestow magical properties to normal

items for a limited time, but eventually these items become
useless due to physical strain or the death of the creator. As

Enchanters attain high level, their spells enable them to create
permanent items of power. These items are called Magic Items.
To craft magical items, the Enchanter must learn certain high
level spells. Through their use, he can create vessels or items
that may contain magical energies. After creating such objects,
the wizard is required to obtain abilities (e.g. characteristics,

Referee’s Guide

59

spells, and skills) from appropriate donors (willing or
unwilling), These abilities are transferred from the target
creature into the vessel. Once accomplished, the object gains
a magical property that is equal to the ability the donor
surrendered. If the Enchanter is powerful enough, he may
empower the item and grant it a permanent existence.

Otherwise, he must maintain the object through the use of
Maintenance Points. This process is draining and very
dangerous, for if the caster removes his Spell Points from the
enchantment, he loses both the item and the components
necessary for the item’s creation, Because of this, crafting a
magical item requires a great deal of time and resources.
Charms, Orbs, Pearls and Pendants
Bead, Annihilation

This bead contains the 7th level Elementalist spell, Incinerate.
When thrown at a target creature and a successful hit is

achieved, the bead bursts into flames and causes 5d10 points

of damage to the victim’s Hit Points. When this occurs, the
magical item is consumed.

Bead, Healing

This bead is enchanted with the 4th level Berethenu spell,
Greater Cure. Each bead has one charge and is capable of
healing 5-10 Hit Points (1d6+4). The item can be used by a
character or may be thrown ata target creature. Healing beads
are typically found in groups of 3d6. Once used, it turns to
dust.
Charm of Telepathy
This item allows the user to cast the 4th level Enchanter spell,

Telepathy. This spell has a limited duration of 5d10 minutes

and a range of 10' to 60' (1d6 x 10'). The item possesses a

number of charges equal to 10d6. Once the charges expire,
the item crumbles to dust.

Jewel of Knowledge

The Jewel of Knowledge grants the holder the Jeweler skill
with a 1d100% base. As long as the object is held, the character
can use this skill to determine the value of gems and other

objects. If the character is already skilled in this proficiency,

Appearing to be a normal gem or jewel, this item contains

8d10 Spell Points that a wizard may draw on when

manipulating magic. Once depleted, it is useless and dissolves.
Pearl, Cursed

This cursed item appears as any other normal pearl. When its
magical enchantment is invoked, it inflicts 5d4 points of
damage to the user’s Hit Points and then vanishes.
Pearl of Flame

This single black pearl contains a number of charges equal to
1d6. Each time a charge is used, the object releases the 6th
level Elementalist spell, Flame Departure. The character is
magically transported to a place that he imagines, providing
it is within range. Because different Elementalists can cast the
spell with varying effects, the range of the spell varies between

10 to 80 (1d8x10) miles. In the user’s wake, a raging fire
damages all creatures, friend or foe, causing 2d10 points of

damage to each victims’ Hit Points. The diameter of effect is
10' to 35’ (1d6+1 multiplied by 5"). Once all of the charges
are depleted, the pearl bursts into flames and is destroyed.
Devices
Boots of the Hunter

These magical hiking boots bestow the wearer with the Tracking
skill. As long as the boots are worn, the character is granted
the skill with a base chance of success equal to 1d100%. If the
character is already proficient in the skill, the boots offer no

benefit. The user does not require a skill slot to gain this ability,

nor can he advance in the skill.
Bracelet of Insight

This item bestows on the wearer an increase of 0.3-3.0 (.3d10)
to the character's Insight. This magical increase lasts for as
long as the item is worn and affects skill slots and the maximum
attainable levels for magic use. Once the item is removed, the
benefits of the magic (and bonus skill slots) are lost.
Enchanted Cloak

Orb of Lightning

This piece of clothing appears to be an ordinary traveling cloak.
When worn by a character that is not wearing armor, the cloak
bestows a magical protection similar to the 2nd level Enchanter
spell, Enchanted Vestment. This protection absorbs between
10 to 35 (1d6+1 x 5) point of damage, and every 24 hours the
cloak is magically repaired.

This small, glass orb is enchanted with the 4th level

Horn of Summoning

the magic item offers no benefit. The character is unable to

advance in the skill despite the number of successful attempts.
The item has no charges and does not require the user to
forfeit a skill slot to operate.

Elementalist spell, Lightning. Each time the character uses a
charge, a bole of lightning flies from the orb and automatically
strikes a target creature. Damage inflicted is equal to 4d10,
which is deducted from the target's Hit Points. The range of
the spell is 10’ to 35' (1d6+1 multiplied by 5'). This item has
a number of charges equal to 10d6.

Orb of Spell Points

Referee’s Guide

When this horn is sounded, the user can attract a specific
target creature within 10' to 35' (1d6+1 x5‘) and force the
creature to attack him in preference to any other character.

This imitates the 4th level Berethenu spell, Summoning. Each
charge has a 100% chance of success and an item of this nature
has 10d6 charges.

Horn of Vitality

Rod of Ice

This item looks like an ordinary horn but is enchanted with
the 3rd level Berethenu spell, Vitality. When a charge is used,
every creature within a 10' to 35’ radius (1d6+1 x5’) is healed

This item allows a character the ability to cast the 1st level
Elementalist spell, Jce Bolt. The range of the spell is 70' to

2 Hit Points. Although this may revive a character from
negatives, it cannot place him above his maximum Hit Point

potential. This magical horn has 10d6 charges. In addition,
each charge will affect everyone in range, friend or foe.
Lens of the Eagle

This glass lens holds the magical properties of the Ist level
Beast Magic spell, Eagle Sight. Each time a charge is used, the
character can see distances equal to 700’ plus 1d6 x 50’ (7501,000 foot range). The charge lasts 4 to 24 minutes (d6 x 4).
An item of this type has 10d6 charges and, when depleted,
the item turns to dust.
Lens of the Medusa

When a character attempts to peer through this cursed item,

the first thing viewed is the magical eye of a Medusa. When
this occurs, the character is forced to a make a Saving Throw
vs. Death or else turn to stone. The affects of the cursed item

are permanent and there is no cure for the affliction. It must
be noted that the character and all his belongings are affected

by the curse.

Periapt of Resist Poison

This piece of jewelry contains a magical enchantment. For as

long as the item is worn, the wearer gains a +3 Saving Throw
against any form of Poison, whether magical or otherwise.
Ring of Fire

This ring is made from steel and is cool to the touch. When
worn, it protects the wearer with the 5th level Elementalist
spell, Immunity to Fire. This protection is strong enough to
negate all damage inflicted by fire, whether magical or
otherwise, while the ring is worn. It has no charges.
Ring of Paralysis

When this cursed ring is worn, it instantly affects the wearer

with the 4th level Necromancer spell, Paralysis. This causes
the character to make a Saving Throw vs. Magic. A success
shows that no ill effect occurred. Failing the save causes the
character to subtract 1 Speed value per minute until 0 is
reached. He then falls into a coma and is completely helpless.
The curse lasts until the victim is cured through the use of a
Cure Disease spell. Once this occurs, the ring dissolves.
Ring of Mist

This item appears to be an ordinary copper ring. When worn,
however, it instantly invokes the 4th level Necromancer spell,

Mist. When a charge is used, the wearer can shift back and
forth between gaseous and solid form for 3 to 18 minutes
(1d6 x 3). The ring has a number of charges equal to 10d6
and once depleted, the item turns to dust.

100' (1d4+6 x 10’). Each charge inflicts 1d10 points of

damage, the majority of which is deducted from the target's
armor. A rod having this magical ability contains 10d6 charges.
Shield, Magical

A magical shield can be of any type (buckler, large, small,

tower, or wooden) and is enchanted with the 6th level

Enchanter spell, Invulnerability. The powerful nature of the
magic protects the item and prohibits it from being damaged
by any type of attack. This means the item never loses defensive
ability despite the damage it absorbs.
Staff of the Elemental

When a charge is expended, this item casts the Ist level
Elementalist spell, Sand Squall. The duration of the spell is 2
to 20 minutes (1d10 x 2). A staff of this magical ability contains
10d6 charges and, once expended, dissolves into dust.
Staff of Harming

This item contains the 3rd level Grom spell Divine Harm
with 10d6 charges. Each use is capable of inflicting 1d6 points

deducted directly from the victim’s Hit Points.

Wand of Pyrotechnics

This powerful staff is capable of casting Pyrotechnics, the 3rd

level Elementalist spell. Each charge inflicts 3d10 points of
damage to a single target creature. The range of the spell is 5'
to 30’ (1d6 x 5’). A staff of this nature possesses 10d6 charges.
Potions
Potion of Awareness

Drinking this liquid increases the character’s Awareness score
by +0.3-3.0 (.3d10). This increase affects the character’s chance
of finding secret doors and may increase his DV1. The bonus
lasts for 6d10 minutes. The potion contains 1d4 sips.

Potion of Parrying
When this potion is used, the character gains the Parrying
skill for Gd10 minutes. The potion contains 1d4 sips.
Potion of Poison

This liquid contains the 2nd level Grom spell, Poison. When
the character drinks the potion he is instantly inflicted with 3

points of damage that must be deducted from his Hit Points.
Although the potion will damage any character that drinks

the liquid, the potion may be applied to a character's weapon
and will function like the spell. When used on a weapon, the

duration of the application is randomly determined between

2 to 20 (2d10) minutes. ‘I'he potion contains 1d4 sips.

Potion of Strength

This potion increases the user’s Strength score by +0.3-3.0
(.3d10). This increase affects melee damage and the chance
of opening doors, The increase lasts for Gd10 minutes. The
potion contains between 1d4 sips.

Weapons
Arrows of Wounding

This quiver typically holds 4d6 arrows that are each enchanted
with the first level Beast Magic spell, Wounding. When used
in combat, each arrow inflicts the normal damage associated

with the type of bow that is used, and, in addition, inflicts an

additional 1d6 points of damage directly to the target’s Hit

Points. Each time an arrow hits, it is dissolved by the magic.
However, arrows that miss may be collected and fired again.

Battle Axe of Strength

This axe inflicts normal damage and offers no increase to the
wielder’s Attack Value. Instead, the weapon increases the user’s

Strength characteristic by 0.3-3.0 (.3d10) and may affect his

damage potential. The increase lasts for as long as the weapon
is held.
Mace of Termination

This weapon inflicts normal damage and offers no increase to
the wielder’s Attack Value. Instead, the item is enchanted with
the 1st level Grom spell, Termination. This grants the user the

Final Blow skill. If the wielder is already proficient in the skill,

he is not eligible for credits toward skill advancement while

using the weapon. The percentage chance granted is equal to
1d100%.

Weapon, Cursed

This weapon is cursed with the 1st level Grom spell, Grom’
Weapon. When grasped, the item is grafted to the character
and it cannot be released, regardless of the character’s attempt

to do so. Other than the awkwardness of always having a

weapon in hand, this magic holds no significant detriment.

The weapon cannot notch and inflicts +1 actual damage per
hit. The only way to remove the curse is through the
administering of a 5th level Berethenu spell, Restore Health.

Weapon +1, +2, +3 or +4

These magical weapons, which can be of any type, increase

the user’s Attack Value. The weapon does not notch and cannot
be broken through normal or magical means. When used, the
character is disqualified from credit toward skill advancement.

Referee’s Guide

This entire section is devoted to the Magic skill. There are two types of magic in Forge: Out of Chaos: Divine

Magic and Pagan Magic.

Divine Magic is defined as a spiritual bond that exists between the character and a chosen deity. Since the magic
is gained through prayer, the
character must follow certain guidelines or codes in exchange for the spell ability. Two deities have dominance
over this type of magic:
Berethenu and Grom. Both gods are battle-oriented, though the codes for each deity are very different. The
major benefit to learning Divine
Magic is that its spells possess no harmful side effects and require no spell components.
Pagan Magic has evolved since the gods departed the world. Egocentric magic-users found they could manipulate
spells without the aid of their
deities by harnessing and channeling magical energies through physical components. They soon realized, however,
that this dangerous practice
was laced with harmful side effects! In addition, the components they require are specific and expensive, without
which, spells cannot be cast.
There are 4 separate spheres in Pagan Magic (Beast, Necromancy, Elemental, and Enchantment). Each one has
its own powers and abilities.
Each one affects its own unique aspect (animals, undead, nature, and magic, respectively). Although all these types
are classified under Pagan

Magic, there are actually 2 sub-branches called Attack Magic (Beast, Necromancy, and Elemental)

and Creation Magic (Enchantment).

Attack Magic is the most powerful form ofspell casting. Magic-users are capable of casting spells that cause damage to
an individual creature
or large groups. In addition, they can increase their spells’ effects by harnessing additional magical energies. Although
this enables the caster to
inflict more damage, enhance the spell’s range, or modify the duration of the spell, it places a great strain on both the
physical component and
the caster’s body! Worse still, if the component is broken, the object explodes and causes physical damage to the wizard.

Beast Magic (sometimes called Marda Magic) reflects the goddess’s powers. A wizard of this type (often referred
to as. a Beast mage) is capable
of casting a variety of spells. Some dominate and mutate animals. Other spells inflict damage on single opponents
or large groups. Still more
transform the wizard into hideous beasts, allowing him to inflict severe wounds while protected from harm!
Although considered to be the
weakest form of Attack Magic, a character that studies Beast Magic is capable of wearing leather armor while
casting spells.
Necromancy Magic appeared after Enigwa banished Necros to the void. A necromancer (the name given to this
type of wizard) is able to make
the dead walk and carry out his commands. In addition, the wizard is capable of inflicting damage upon a single
foe or multiple targets. Even
more diabolical, however, is the temporary transformation of the caster’s own body into that of an undead
creature! Because of their immoral
use of the dead, necromancers are outlawed, feared and hated in many areas of the world. A character that
studies this type of magic is capable
of wearing padded armor while practicing his dark art.
Elemental Magic is the most powerful form of Attack Magic. A mage can harness the elemental forces of nature,
and use this power to cause
great destruction. Whether targeting a single foe or blasting large groups, the elementalist (as a wizard of this type
is called) has the highest
damage potential of any attack mage. His spells allow him to communicate with nature, control the weather
and transform himself into
creations of air, earth, fire, and water. Although regarded as the most powerful spell caster, a character learning this
type of magic may not wear
armor of any type when casting spells.

Creation Magic offers a different path for spell casters. Unlike Attack Magic, Creation Magic does not focus on causing

physical damage.

Instead, it uses its powers to enchant people and items with magical abilities. Like other Pagan Magic, the art
requires physical components to
manipulate spells. However, these components disintegrate each time a spell is cast. Because of this, it isa very expensive
type of magic. Another
difference between Attack and Creation Magic is the duration of an Enchanter’s spell. In Attack Magic, wizards
are capable of extending the
length of time a spell exists by damaging their components or their bodies. Even in this manner, the spell is only
potent for a few minutes or
hours. In Creation Magic, a wizard is capable of prolonging a spell indefinitely without any physical harm or danger.
Enchantment Magic is used to create magic items. Enchanters (as masters of this art are named) use
their powers to drain characteristics, skills
and abilities from target creatures and transfer them into objects such as rings, wands, and weapons.
Although capable of creating magical
items, enchanters have other powers as well. Unable to wear armor, these magic-users are capable of creating
magical robes that enhance their

Armor Rating and absorb damage. They can read minds, enchant weapons and create magical guardians. Unlike
other mages, enchanters are
able to maintain their spell effects indefinitely. This is done through the expenditure of Maintenance Points. For more
information on Maintenance
Points, look in the Enchanter Spell Section.

level spells). A wizard studying Pagan Magic (Beast, Necromancy, Elemental, or Enchantment) has a slightly better selection as he can learn
spells up to one level higher than his current Magic level (e.g. a 1st level Elementalist can learn up to 2nd level spells). Second, Pagan Magic
requires components. The Player should review the costs associated with buying these items and then choose spells the character can afford.
Now, the time has come to develop the character's spells. The Player
must choose the first spell his character will learn. At the end of each
spell level there are schematic tables which are referenced in the spell
descriptions. Each table is labeled with a heading (e.g. Duration).
The Player must roll 1d20 for each table required for the spell and
record the results.

D20 Rot

DuRATION

D20 Roti

Save Moburizr

Look at the 1st level schematic table to the right. You can see that
there are two separate categories: Duration and Save Modifier. For
the character to learn this spell, the Player must roll 1d20 on the

Duration schematic and 1d20 on the Save Modifier schematic. Each roll is recorded along with the appropriate result. For example, a Player

rolls 1d20 and scores a 16 for Duration and rolls the d20 again, scoring a 3 for Save Modifier. Whenever this spell is cast, it lasts for
and gives the target creature a +2 Saving Throw modifier.

20 minutes

a spell
Congratulations, your character has learned his first spell! The good news is, the character learned a spell. The bad news is, he consumed
attempt. Each character has a certain number of spell attempts per level. This number is equal to the character’s Intellect score (rounded down).
So, a character with an 11.6 Intellect has 11 spell attempts per level.
If the Player is unhappy with the +2 Save Modifier (you could get up to +6), he has the option of “tweaking” the spell. This means that you can
roll your d20’s over again and attempt to get higher numbers. The good part about this is that your character could improve his knowledge of
the selected spell. The bad part is that it requires another spell attempt. Although you cannot get worse, a spell attempt is still consumed, even
if you do not improve! Be wary when you choose to tweak spells. You could end up wasting your spell atcempts and learn only one or two spells.
Even if you don't get the best result, don’t worry. As the character advances in level, he gains more spell attempts and may re-learn old spells.
D20 Rot

DURATION

D20 Ro.

For those power-hungry Players, wizards dealing with Pagan Magic

can learn spells one level above their current Magic level. When
attempting to learn higher level spells, the character suffers a -2 penalty
per schematic roll, due to the spell’s complexity.
Consider the 2nd level schematic table to the left. You will notice

that, like the one before, it has two separate categories. You may also

notice that the numbers are slightly different, resulting in a 21+ for
the best result. Since the character is a 1st level wizard and this is a
2nd level spell, the Player must subtract 2 from each d20 roll. It is
therefore impossible for him to obtain the best result. For example, if
a 3 for
the d20 roll scores a 20, the Player would subtract 2 and record an 18 (20 minutes). Not bad. Rolling the d20 again, the Player scores

the Range category. Since we must subtract 2 points the score equals 1. This is the worst result the Player could obtain. Although it would
require an additional spell attempt, the Player may decide to tweak the spell and try to get better. Since he is already the best in Duration, he
(9-2=7).
does not need to roll on that schematic again. Rolling the d20, the Player scores a 9. After subtracting the modifier we see he scored a7
He increased his Range from Touch to 15’. It’s an improvement, but he used one spell attempt to do so.

You may ask, “How do I get higher than a 20?” Good question. There are two ways. First, wizards who learn spells lower than their current

Magic level get a +2 modifier (per level below) to divide among the schematic tables. For example, a 3rd level magician attempting

to learn a

2nd level spell receives a +2 modifier. He could add +1 to each category or +2 to one. Either way, he must decide before he rolls the d20. Second,
for each slot over 10 invested in the Magic skill, a character earns a +1 modifier per spell attempt. At the beginning, this option is only available
to Pagan Magic (characters that learn Divine Magic earn bonuses as they advance in levels but cannot start with them). Modifiers may be
distributed among the various schematic tables as the Player sees fit.
Magic

65

With this in mind, let us revisit at the 1st level schematic table. For simplicity’s sake, say the character has invested 12 skill slots in
the Magic
skill. This gives him a +2 modifier. He can give each category a +1 modifier or give one category a +2 modifier. Looking at the table, the Player
decides he would rather have a better Duration. He puts his +2 in that category. He rolls the d20 and records his results. In this situation, if
the
Player rolls an 18, 19 or 20 in Duration, he would learn the best result (30 minutes) since he has the +2 modifier. If he is unhappy
with the
results, he could tweak the spell, redistribute his modifiers and try again. Remember to keep track of the spell attempts. In the above
example
it is obvious that investing additional skill slots in the Magic skill gains a definite advantage.
There is another advantage for wizards studying Attack Magic. You may recall that wizards involved in Attack Magic may increase their
spells’
effects by harnessing and warping the magical energies. This practice often referred to as “pumping”, enables the mage to inflict more damage,
enhance the range of the spell, or modify the length of time the spell remains in effect. “Pumping” places a great strain on both the
physical
component and the caster’s body. As more skill slots are invested in learning magic, the character's chance of breaking his component is reduced.
Let's review this aspect of Attack Magic in greater detail.
A wizard studying Attack Magic must expend Spell Points to cast a spell. However, if he opts to use more Spell Points than the

minimum

number required, he is able to increase the spell’s Range, Duration, Damage, Save Modifier or Chance of Success. Each time a character

“pumps” a spell (uses additional spell points), he is able to increase one of these five categories. The table below illustrates the three
types of
Attack Magic and the benefits associated with “pumping” spells.

From the table above, it is easy to see how “pumping” a spell benefits the Attack Mage. Increasing the Range might allow the character
to hit
a potential enemy who is too far away to fight back. Extending the Duration means the spell will last longer. Raising the Damage
will kill a
potential threat faster, and so on. Since the benefits are quite clear, you might ask, “How many times can I ‘pump’ a spell?”. To find your answer,
just check the following table:

Each time a wizard uses additional Spell Points, he has a chance of breaking his physical component. This is dangerous. If the component

breaks, the caster suffers damage based upon the level of the spell and the number of times the spell is “pumped”. Consider
Spett Lever

1 Pump / DAMAGI

2 Pumps / Damact

3 Pumps / DAMaci

the following table:

4 Pumps / DAMAGt

Although increasing the effects of a spell is beneficial, it is also extremely dangerous. A wizard that casts a 1st level spell has a 25%
chance
(determined by 1d100) of breaking the component. If this occurs, the character suffers 2 points of actual damage. This is deducted
directly
from Hit Points. If the mage had “pumped” the Ist level spell two times, there would be a 30% chance that the component breaks. If it does,
the mage suffers 4 points of damage and will need to purchase (or find) another one before casting that particular spell again!
You might say, “It’s not worth it!”. A very reasonable conclusion, providing you didn’t receive modifiers. As Attack Mages invest additional
slots
in the Magic skill, they not only receive modifiers to their schematic rolls, but they receive modifiers toward “pumping” spells as
well. This
makes it much safer for the character to increase his spell’s effects. Safer, but not foolproof! Consider the table at the top of the

After careful study, you will notice that the more skill slots you place in the Magic skill, the better overall spell caster your character becomes.
First, he gains increases to his schematic rolls (+1 per additional slot). This allows him to learn spells with better results. Second, he can “pump”
spells with less fear of suffering damage and losing his component. In fact, a character that has 20 skill slots in the Magic skill could “pump” a
1st level spell two times or a 2nd level spell one time without any potential for component loss or personal damage.
The last consideration in this section is the number of Spell Points required to “pump” a spell. Each
spell has a schematic table dedicated to Additional Spell Point expenditures (Add. SPTS). When a

D20 Rou

App. SPTS

character learns a spell, he rolls 1d20 off this table and records the result. From then on, it requires
that number of Spell Points each time the character “pumps” the spell.

Consider the following example. To the right is a schematic table from a Ist level Necromancer spell

which requires 8 Spell Points to cast. A character rolls a d20 and scores a 14. He records +5 SPTS on
his character sheet under the appropriate spell heading. Each time the character uses this spell, it costs
him 8 SPTS. If the Player wants to increase the spell’s effect, it would cost the character an additional

+5 SPTS. This totals 13. If the Player wants to “pump” the spell twice, it would require 18 SPTS to

cast! Each time the spell is “pumped” the character can increase the Range, Duration, Damage, Save

Modifier or Chance of Success. Although “pumping” spells becomes addictive, Players should give careful consideration when using additional
Spell Points.

Spell Characteristics

There are seven fundamental categories governing the manipulation of magic spells: Component, Duration, Insight, Level, Range, Spell Points
(SPTS), and Target. Although not every one of these categories is present in every spell, they play an important role in magic as a whole.
Component: determines the type of component needed to cast a given spell (e.g. Minor Damage, Minor Knowledge, and Major Domination).

Without the proper component, spells cannot be cast. This is only necessary for Attack Magic (i.e. Beast, Elemental, and Necromancy).
Duration: determines how long the spell remains in effect. There are three types of duration:
Instantaneous - takes effect immediately and lasts only a brief second. Usually this period applies to damaging spells.
Permanent - spell lasts forever. Domination and healing spells are often permanent.
Minute(s) - lasts an amount of time determined by the schematic table or until the caster chooses to negate it.

Insight: all spells have a minimum Insight requirement necessary to cast the spell. If the wizard does not possess an Insight score equal to or
higher than the one displayed, he is unable to learn the spell!
Level: determines the spell’s complexity. Each spell level is increasingly more difficult to learn (the maximum scores on the schematic tables

increase). Also, the higher level spells have more dangerous Harmful Side Effects. A character that did not invest additional skill
Magic skill must settle for mediocre effects when attempting to learn higher level spells.

slots in the

Range: displayed as Touch, Melee or Distance, the wizard must be in the appropriate range in order for the spell to function.
Touch requires that the Player roll an attack (1d20) to physically touch his target. The character’s Attack Value is determined by adding
his current Magic level to any Dexterity modifiers. In addition, the wizard is only required to touch a DVO. If the caster fails to touch
the target creature, the Spell Points are expended, no effect occurs, and no credit toward Magic advancement is received.
Melee range is considered 5’ from the target. These spells automatically function and do not require a d20 roll.
Distance can be static ranges (e.g. 30’) or determined by schematic tables.

Magic

Spell points (SPTS): display the number of Spell Points required to cast the spell. If the caster does not have the required number,

cannot be cast. Higher level spells require a greater amount of spell energy to cast than do lower level ones.

the spell

Target: shows the destination of the spell (whether creature, object or area). Some spells have a schematic table for this category. These tables
might allow a wizard to focus his spell on multiple targets or affect a larger area.

Schematic Table Overview

Each schematic table represents a different aspect of the magic. There are several types of tables that are used to determine the effects of
a spell.
These tables are located at the end of each spellcasters section. The various types that can be encountered are as follows:
Additional Damage: shows the additional damage the recipient of the spell inflicts while the spell is in effect.
Additional Hit Points: increases the Hit Points of the spell’s recipient. This can place a creature above its maximum
Hit Point potential but
may not be healed.

Additional SPTS: the number of additional Spell Points required to “pump” a spell.
Area of Effect: determines the area that is affected by the spell.
Armor Points: increases the recipient’s Armor Rating and absorbs damage. As the Armor Points are reduced, the spell offers less protection.
Armor Points Repaired: magically repairs damage inflicted to a suit of non-magical armor. The spell can restore any type of damage
including acid, weapons, etc. Although capable of mending armor, this effect cannot repair a suit of armor that has been destroyed.

Armor Rating: displays the magical increase to the recipient’s Armor Rating. This type of spell does not absorb damage.
Attack Value: reflects a magical increase or decrease to the recipient's Attack Value. This affects any weapon the character uses but an
increased
AV disqualifies him from credit toward Weapon Skill advancement.
Capacity: shows the volume (in gold coins) that a vessel can hold.
Chance of Notching: protects a weapon from notching. While the spell is in effect, there is a smaller percentage

involved will sustain damage.

Chance of Success: illustrates the character’s chance of successfully using the spell. The Player should roll 1d100 when the spell is cast. If the
result is equal to or lower than the schematic table result, the spell is a success. If the roll is higher, the magic has no effect.
Characteristic Increase/Decrease: increases or decreases the appropriate characteristic of the character by the amount displayed on the
schematic table. This effect lasts until the spell expires.
Damage: illustrates the amount of damage inflicted on a target creature.

Harmful Side Effects (HSE): are the detrimental effects caused by lack of Divine influence in the casting of spells. The exact detriment is
determined by the character's schematic roll. Ifa Harmful Side Effect exists in a spell, it occurs every time the spell is cast! The following is a list
of the various Harmful Side Effects and the definitions of each.
Magic Implosion - a devastating side effect that ignites the magical energies wielded by the caster. All creatures standing within 100°
(including the caster) suffer 10d6 points of actual damage. This damage must be deducted from the Hit Points of all affected.

Consumption — means that the spell caster must roll 1d100 every time the spell is cast. If the result is equal to or less than the score on
the schematic table, the spell caster survives. If the roll is over, the caster is consumed by the magical energies and is irrevocably lost!
Characteristic Loss — results in the permanent loss of a specific characteristic (Stamina, Intellect, or Insight) displayed on the schematic

table. In addition to the characteristic affected, the schematic table also displays the amount lost. This loss may affect the character
(i.e. Hit Points, maximum number of skills, etc.) and should be subtracted immediately.

Damage - causes the spell caster to sustain physical wounds. Hit Points may be healed through magical healing, sleeping or the
administering of healing roots. The amount of damage inflicted is shown on the schematic table.
Mental Exhaustion — clouds the wizard’s mind and prevents concentration. This “exhaustion” prohibits all spell casting for a length of
time determined by the schematic table.

Extra SPTS Used - drains a certain amount of additional spell points from the caster. This draining happens after the spell is cast. If the
caster does not have sufficient spell points to compensate for the drain, an equal number of Hit Points will be deducted instead.
Healing: determines the amount of Hit Points the recipient is bestowed.
Jump Distance: reflects the distance a character can jump when using the spell.
Maintenance Points: apply only to enchanters! This category has a schematic table that determines the number of points necessary to
maintain the spell’s duration. As long as the Enchanter uses her Maintenance Points to keep the spell active, the effects last indefinitely.

Number Affected: reflects the number of targets that are affected by the spell.
Number of Languages: demonstrates the number of languages that an Enchanter can understand or bestow upon a recipient creature.

Retained Spell Points per Day: illustrates the amount of Spell Points a transformed Elementalist may use each day. In addition, it shows the
number of Spell Points retained by a transformed Necromancer.
Save Modifier: affects the Saving Throw of the victim for as long as the spell is in effect. This can be either beneficial or detrimental.
Sight Distance: is dependent upon the type of spell cast. It can either reflect an increase to the actual visual range of the caster or the magical
ability to see invisible objects at a certain distance. This altered sight lasts until the spell expires.
Skill Proficiency: grants the caster a distinct skill and skill base that lasts as long as the spell is in effect.
Spell Points Lost: reflects the Spell Points that are permanently drained from the caster.
Telekinetic Ability: reflects the strength of the Telekinesis spell. This schematic has two effects. First, it indicates the weight a character can lift
with his mind. The other is the additional damage the character can cause with the spell.

Transfer Amount: shows the amount of characteristics that may be transferred between an Enchanter and a target creature.

Beast Magic
Beast Magic (a form of Pagan Magic) was developed after the gods
were taken from Juravia. It mimics the powers of the goddess Marda,
allowing a wizard great influence over the animal kingdom. An
influence so strong, in fact, the she can control the minds of animals,
mimic their attacks, and alter their bodies to create monstrous
protectors.

This type of magic falls into Attack Magic, though it is the weakest
form of that category. Although not as damaging as Necromancy
Magic or Elemental Magic, a character is able to wear leather armor
and still cast spells. This advantage, combined with the ability to
dominate and/or mutate animals, more than compensates for its lower
damage potential.
In Attack Magic, a wizard can increase her spells’ effects. This is
done through the expenditure of additional Spell Points at the time
of casting. By choosing to increase a spell, the caster is able to enhance
one area (Range, Duration, Damage, Save Modifier, or Chance of

Success) of that spell. The following chart displays the benefit of

increasing each variable.

There are ten different components that are used to manipulate Beast

Magic. Each one allows the casting of a select group of spells, which

are broken down into categories (Damage, Domination, Knowledge,
Mutation, and Protection). Spells between the levels of Ist to 4th

require minor components while spells between the levels of 5th to

8th require major components. If the caster does not have a specific

component, she will not be able to cast that category of spell. Because
components are expensive, Players should consider their character’s
spell selections carefully. The character should not learn spells if she
does not have (or cannot obtain) the component required to cast the

desired spell.

Magic

The following is a list of the various spell categories, components, and their cost.
Minor Protection Spells: Ash Wood- can be fashioned into a staff, bow, cane or any other object of at least 4' in length. During its creation, the

object must be soaked in a mixture of blood from various animals and then dried with a cloth made from the fur ofa wolf. The normal cost for

this rare wood and the required treatment is 165 gold coins.

Minor Mutation Spells: Giant Spider Fur, Harpy Feathers, Kesharu Scales - only one is required to cast this category ofspells. No other talisman

will harness and control the magic. The component is expensive because it must be soaked in wine and left to dry in the presence ofa full moon.
‘The typical cost is 95 gold coins.
Minor Damage Spells: Manticore Spike - only one intact spike is needed. This spike costs 35 gold coins.
Minor Knowledge Spells: /vory Pendant- must be sculpted from the horn ofa Minotaur. The pendant must be at least 2" across and

attached

to a chain of pure silver. The pendant’s construction costs 130 gold coins.

Minor Domination Spells: Animal Skull-Giant Snake or Bren. It must be polished and painted with symbols and patterns. The paint must be
a mixture of ivory dust, tree sap and animal blood. Typically the skull and pigments cost 60 gold coins.

Animal Warding

Using this spell’s protection, all animals, having less than 25 Hit Points are required to make a Saving Throw vs. Magic prior to attacking the
wizard. If the save is failed, the animal will be unable to attack unless the caster first causes it physical damage. If the save is successful, the
animal may attack the caster but receives a -1 Attack Value due to the spell.

Arachnia

Mimicking a spider, the Arachnia spell allows the caster to climb any surface. For the spell’s duration, the Player must roll 1d100 each time her

character attempts to climb (either vertically or horizontally). If the score is equal to or lower than the character’s schematic table result, it is a
success! Movement rate while climbing is equal to 20' per minute. If the attempt fails, the caster falls and suffers appropriate falling damage
(when applicable). The spell allows movement on walls and ceilings with the same chance of success. Also, if the character is already proficient
in the Climbing skill, the schematic table percentage is added to the character’s skill base. In this situation the character would not receive a
credit toward Climbing skill advancement.

Chameleon

Casting this spell allows the mage to change her natural coloration and blend into the surroundings, When employed, the spell grants the caster

the Hiding skill with a limited duration. Each minute the character attempts to hide, the Player should roll 1d100. Scoring equal to or less than
the character's schematic table percentage results in a success. The character remains unseen and therefore cannot be attacked. In addition, she

may gain surprise on unwary creatures. If the attempt is failed, the character is not hidden and can be seen. Creatures having Heat Vision or

Undead Vision can automatically see the wizard. If the character is already proficient in the Hiding skill, the schematic table percentage is added
to the character's skill base. In this situation, the character would not receive a credit toward Hiding skill advancement.

Eagle Sight

The eyesight of the Mage is magically heightened when the Eagle Sight spell is cast. The caster can see great distances with perfect clarity.
Writing on parchment, designs on shields, etc. can all be seen even at the maximum sight distance allowed by the spell. Although the caster can
see far distances clearly, objects and creatures standing within 30' of the caster will be blurry and unclear, The ability to attack, or defend against
melee attacks, is dramatically affected by the spell. The mage suffers a -3 AV penalty in combat, and all attacks are made against his DV2.

Jump

The Jump spell allows the caster to perform one outstanding leap (forward, backward or upward) from a standing position. Despite the distance

the wizard can jump, the leap is modified as follows: full distance forward, 1/2 distance upward and 1/4 distance backward. When jumping
forward or backward the caster’s highest elevation is equal to her physical height. The caster lands on her feet without fail.
The Beast Mage may attack a creature while jumping as long as the creature is within melee range. When attacking in mid-jump, the character

gains a +2 Attack Value due to surprise and the opponent receives a -2 Attack Value penalty. Even though a character may attack, no spells may
be cast during the leap. The caster can make one jump per Magic skill level. When the spell’s duration expires, the ability is lost.

72

Magic

Musk

Employing this spell, the caster creates a foul odor that surrounds his character. This odor affects any humanoid creature that enters melee range
(5') and forces it to make a Saving Throw vs. Magic. Success indicates the spell has no effect. If failed, the creature suffers a -2 Attack Value. This

penalty is negated after the spell expires.

Perception

When this spell is cast, it heightens the character's senses, allowing her a percentage chance of using the Observation skill. The Player must roll

1d100. A score equal to or lower than the character’s schematic table score equals a success. The wizard is instantly aware of all creatures hiding

in the area, including those who have successfully used the Hiding skill. A failure means the character did not detect the ambush. If the

character is already proficient at the Observation skill, the schematic table percentage is added to her skill base. In this situation, the character
does not receive a credit toward Observation skill advancement.

Quills

When the words to this spell are invoked, small quills began to grow from the caster’s body. These magical quills (which have a maximum
length of 1') increase the caster’s Armor Rating by 1 and inflict 1d2 damage to any creature that attacks through physical means (e.g. biting,

punching, or touching). This damage is deducted directly from the creature’s Hit Points. When the spell expires, the quills dissolve into wisps
of smoke.

Speak with Animals

This spell enables the caster to talk with small animals such as birds, mice, rats, and squirrels for as long as the spell is active. Although the caster

can speak with these animals, these creatures are not required to respond. Because of this, it might be necessary to use bribery (bits of food,
cloth, etc.) in order to gain their knowledge.

Spike

Using magical energies, the Beast Mage creates a spike (similar to one found on a Manticore’s tail) and hurls it at his enemy. This weapon

automatically hits and inflicts 1d6 points of damage. If the creature is not wearing armor, all the damage is deducted from its Hit Points. If
armor is present, the spell inflicts 1 Hit Point of damage, with the remainder being deducted from its Armor Points.

Tracking

When invoked, this spell heightens the senses of the caster allowing him to perform the Tracking skill. When cast, the Player must roll 1d100.
A score equal to or lower than his character’s schematic table percentage results in a success. For the spell’s duration, the caster is able to follow
the tracks without fail. If the attempt is failed, the spell has no effect. The caster may still attempt another 1d100 roll each minute until the
duration expires. If the caster is already skilled in the Tracking skill, the schematic table percentage is added to his skill base. In this situation, the
character would not receive a credit toward Tracking skill advancement.
Magic

73

Wounding

When the Beast Mage uses this spell, he can inflict wounds with his mere touch. The Player is required to roll 1d20 with his character’s AV

being equal to his current Magic skill level plus his Dexterity modifier. The character need only hit a DV 0. If successful, the wizard inflicts 1d6
point of damage directly to the victim’s Hit Points. If the attack fails, the spell has no effect. The character receives only one attack per spell.

2nd Level
Animal Domination

Using the power of domination, the Beast Mage attempts to permanently befriend a target animal. When attempted, the Player must roll
1d100. If the result is equal to or lower than the character’s schematic table score, the animal is completely loyal to the caster. Otherwise, the

spell has no effect. This magic affects dogs, hawks, horses, snakes, rats, and wolves. If the caster is cruel to the animal, the beast receives a Saving
Throw vs. Magic. If successful, the animal is no longer under his control. The mage permanently loses 2 SPTS for each animal he dominates.

Blinding

When the Beast Mage invokes this spell, her pupils fade and her eyes turn pale white. When engaged in melee combat with an adversary, her
eyes flash a blinding light (similar to a Cavasha). At the start of each combat minute, the caster’s victim is required to make a Saving Throw vs.

Magic. If successful, the spell has no effect. If failed, however, the victim receives a -3 Attack Value penalty due to temporary blindness. In
addition, the Beast Mage need only hit its DV2. This detriment lasts until the end of that combat minute at which time the victim’s eyesight

is restored. This continues until the spell’s duration expires. Creatures that do not “see” or are already blind (e.g. Cavasha, Power Moss, and

Tendril) and are not affected by the spell. Furthermore, using the Gaze Evasion skill may nullify this spell’s effects.

Echo Vision

The Echo Vision spell enables the caster to produce barely audible shrieks, allowing him to “see” even in total darkness (similar to bats). When
a character is forced to fight while blinded (by darkness or other means), he receives a-10 AV penalty. While the spell is in effect, the character

reduces the Attack Value penalty associated with Blind Fighting. Each combat minute, the Player must roll 1d100. If the score is equal to or
lower than the character's schematic table percentage, it is a success. In this case, the character only receives the negative AV penalty determined
by his schematic result. If the attempt is failed, the caster suffers the full negative penalty for that combat minute. If the character is already
proficient in the Blind Fighting skill, his schematic percentage is added to his skill base. Since this increases his chances of success, the mage is
disqualified from credit toward advancement. Although the spell reduces the character's AV penalty, all attacks are still made on his DV2.

Fangs

Casting this spell causes the caster to transform his facial features into that of a monstrous canine. His teeth harden and become long and

pointed. His jaws enlarge, allowing him to bite opponents and cause wounds. Each combat minute (throughout the spell’s duration), the caster

can attempt to bite his victim. The Player must roll 1d20 with the character's Attack Value equal to his current Magic skill level added to any
Dexterity modifier. Since he is attacking, he must strike his opponent’s DV1 or DV2. A successful hit inflicts 1d4 points of damage. If the
victim is wearing armor, the attack destroys 1 Armor Point and the rest is deducting from its Hit Points. Although he can cast spells in his
altered state, the character may not perform any other action when biting an opponent.

Minor Mutation

Using the powers of Beast Magic, the caster is able to increase the size and mass of a target animal. This increase affects both its Hit Points and

Damage potential. Since the spell does not give the caster control over the beast, it is usually cast upon a creature the wizard has already
dominated. The spell effects dogs, hawks, horses, rats, snakes, and wolves. Once the duration expires, the animal reverts to normal size.

When invoked, the caster bellows forth a mighty roar like a lion or other large beast. All humanoid creatures in the area of effect (friend or foe)
are required to make a Saving Throw vs. Fear. Success indicates the spell has no effect. A failure, however, means the affected creature(s)

will

turn and flee from the caster for a period of 244 minutes. The creature(s) will travel directly away from the caster at their fastest movement rate.

If cornered, each creature receives a -2 Attack Value and initiative penalty due to the intense panic instilled by the magic. The spell has no effect
on creatures that are deaf or immune to fear.

Scales

When this spell is cast, it transforms the caster’s skin into thick leathery scales. This mutation increases the Armor Rating of the caster by 3
points and lasts as long as the spell is active. Although the scales make the character harder to hit, they do not absorb damage.

Animal Mutation

Animal Mutation allows the caster to transform an ordinary animal (dog, hawk, horse, rat, snake, or wolf) into a monstrous beast. When cast,

the Beast Mage must choose one of the following effects: Scales, Fiery Breath, or Quills. Once the decision is made, the target animal is affected

throughout the spell’s duration. Beside the mutations, the animal receives a +3 AV. This spell does not give the mage control of the animal.

Seales - thick scales grow over the animal’s skin, which increases its Armor Rating by 4 points.
Fiery Breath - the target animal can breathes flames on a melee opponent once every 3 combat minutes. This breath is added to any other attack
forms the animal possesses. The fire inflicts 2d4 points of damage to the target’s Hit Points.
Quills - ridged quills grow through the animal's skin, increasing its AR by 2 points. Any creature making a melee attack on the target animal
suffers 2 points of actual damage.

Claws

When this spell is invoked, the caster’s fingers transform into long, sharp claws. These weapons inflict severe wounds with each successful hit.

The character can attack twice per combat minute and each attack requires the Player to roll 1d20. The caster’s AV is determined by adding his
current Magic skill level with any Dexterity modifier. Since he must physically strike his target, he is required to hit its DV1 or DV2. Each hit

inflicts 1d6 points of damage. If armor is present, only 1 point is subtracted from Hit Points while the rest is subtracted from its Armor Points.
The character’s Strength score modifies this damage. The caster can negate the spell at anytime, but cannot employ spells while it is active.

Dragon Sight

Using the powers of magic, the caster’s eyes become reptilian in appearance and his vision is extended to twice normal range. In addition, he can
detect hidden and invisible creatures with 100% accuracy, providing they are within the sight distance granted by the schematic roll.

Eye Shielding

Manipulating this magic, the caster grows a pair of translucent eyelids, granting him the Gaze Evasion skill. Each time the wizard is subjected
to such an attack, the Player must roll 1d100. If the score is equal to or lower than his character’s schematic table result, it is a success. The
character is immune to the harmful effect for that minute. If the roll fails, the spell offers no protection. If the caster is already skilled in Gaze
Evasion, the schematic table percentage is added to his skill base. However, the character is not eligible for credit toward skill advancement.

Hooded Fangs

Mutating her body, the Beast Mage transforms her upper torso into a massive, hooded serpent. Although unable to use weapons or cast spells,
she can deliver a powerful bite once per minute. This bite, which requires a 1d20 attack roll, inflicts 2d6 points of damage. Only 2 points of the
damage are deducted from the victim’s Armor Points. The remainder must be subtracted directly from its Hit Points. The character’s AV is
calculated by adding her current Magic skill level to any Dexterity modifier. The snake’s hood is covered with hypnotic patterns that bewilder
viewers, causing attackers on the character’s DV2 to suffer a -1 AV. The caster can choose to dispel this magic at any time.

Magic

Insect Shell

Calling upon the magical powers of protection, the character surrounds himself with a shell of flying insects. Any creature standing within 5'

(melee range) suffers 1d4 points of damage for each minute of exposure. The damage is deducted directly from the victim’s Hit Points. Besides
suffering damage, the victim(s) also suffer a -3 AV and initiative modifier. The swarm cannot be attacked and disperses when the spell expires.

Minor Shifting

This spell transforms the wizard into a small animal (bat, mouse, rat, squirrel, etc.) of her choosing. While altered, she is unable to cast spells,
use skills, or communicate with humanoid creatures. The caster gains the benefits and abilities of the animal (e.g. flight) and can communicate

fluently with animals of the selected species. The caster may change form as often as desired. Each transformation requires 1 full minute.

Sonic Wail

Using this magic to produce a piercing scream, the caster causes 2d6 points of damage to all humanoid creatures in the area of effect. Although

this spell affects humanoids (whether friend or foe), it does not cause damage to animals. Deaf creatures are immune to the spell. The damage
is deducted directly from the victims’ Hit Points.

Venomous Spit

Casting Venomous Spit, the caster spews forth a blast of venom upon a single target creature. This attack requires a successful hit. The Player

must roll 1d20. His AV is calculated by adding his character's current Magic skill level to any Dexterity modifier. The mage is required to hit a

DV 0. If the attack is successful, the victim must make a Saving Throw vs. Poison or else be blinded for 5d6 minutes. This affliction instantly
affects the creature’s AV and defensive scores (see Blind Fighting). If the victim makes his Saving Throw, the spell has no effect.

4th Level
Blood Drain

When the Beast Mage invokes this spell, it enables her to drain the blood of a target victim. The spell’s effect requires 1 full minute of
concentration. Each combat minute, thereafter, the caster inflicts 1d6 points of damage, which is deducted from the victim’s Hit Points. As
long as the caster concentrates, she may drain the target's life force. The caster may change victims, but this requires another full minute of
concentration. While the caster is inflicting damage, she is unable to perform other actions, and all attacks are made on her DV2.

Cocoon

Similar to a butterfly cocoon, this magic protects the caster from harm. While protected, the caster’s Armor Rating is increased to 7 and he

receives only 1/4 damage from all attacks (magical and otherwise). In addition, the character regenerates lost Hit Points at the rate of 1 point

every 4 minutes. Unable to cast spells, attack, move, or perform any actions, the caster may negate the spell at any time.
Magic

77

Dragon Fire

Dragon Fire allows the caster to breathe forth a blast of fire. This attack automatically hits a melee victim and inflicts 3d6 points of damage,

which is deducted directly from its Hit Points. Creatures that are immune to fire are impervious to this spell.

Heal Animal

The caster is able to heal a wounded animal by transferring her own life force to the target creature. When the spell is cast, the Beast Mage
suffers 1 Hit Point of damage. In exchange for this loss, the target animal is healed between 2 to 12 Hit Points (depending on the caster’s
schematic table result). The spell only heals animals or beasts and has no effect on humanoid creatures.

Scorpion

When the spell is cast, the wizard’s lower torso sprouts a large tail that grows to a length of 6, Similar to that of a scorpion, this tail has a sharp
stinger that is used as a weapon in melee combat to attack creatures on the caster’s DV1 or DV2. Each combat minute, the Player can roll 1d20

to strike a potential victim. The character's Attack Value is determined by adding his current Magic skill level with any Dexterity modifiers. If
successful, the character inflicts 2d6 points of damage. Only 2 points are deducted from the victim's Hit Points, while its Armor Points absorbs
the remainder. In addition to using the tail, the caster may perform other actions.

Stunning

When Stunning is employed, the caster touches a single humanoid opponent and causes it to make a Saving Throw vs. Magic. This requires the

Player to roll 1d20. The character’s Attack Value is determined by modifying his Magic skill level using any Dexterity modifiers. Since the spell

only requires a touch, the caster must hit the target creature’s DV U. If the caster touches his victim, the creature is forced to make its Saving
Throw, with a modifier of +3. If the save is successful, the victim suffers no ill effect. If the save is failed, however, the victim loses 1 point from
its Speed characteristic each minute until it reaches 0. At this time, the victim is paralyzed for 3 full minutes and is unable to defend itself. All
attacks are made against the subject’s DV2. Afterward, the magic dissipates and the creature returns to normal.

Tentacles

When cast, the Beast Mage undergoes a hideous physical transformation. Four 4' long, rubbery tentacles sprout from the caster’s back and

sides. These appendages are used as weapons in melee combat. The Player is able to roll 1d20 for each tentacle. The character’s Attack Value is
calculated by adding his current Magic skill level to any Dexterity modifiers. The magician must strike his victim’s DV1. Each hit inflicts 1d4

points of damage. In addition, the tentacle latches onto the victim and remains attached for the duration of the spell. The tentacle does not

inflict additional damage. However, each attached tentacle reduces the victim’s AV by 1. Although the caster must attack the same victim with

all four tentacles, he may perform other actions as well (e.g. cast a spell). Each tentacle has an AR of 2 and can sustain damage equal to the
wizard’s Stamina characteristic (rounded down). Once sufficient damage is inflicted or the spell expires, the tentacles dissolve.

5th Level
Constriction

When Constriction is cast, a magical serpent is created that slithers forward and attacks the target creature. The AV of the beast is equal to the
caster’s current Magic skill level. The creation only needs to strike the victim’s DV2. If the attack is unsuccessful, the spell is negated. If the

attack succeeds, the snake inflicts 2d6 points of damage and coils itself around the target. Each minute thereafter, the victim suffers 1d2 points

of actual damage due to constriction. In addition, since the coils interfere with attacks, the victim suffers a -1 AV. In combat, the magical

serpent has an AR of 5 and can sustain damage equal to the caster’s Hit Points. Once sufficient damage is inflicted, the magic dissolves.

Dragon Fear

Invoking this magic, the caster creates a thunderous roar that causes all creatures (friend or foe) in the area of effect to turn and flee. No Saving

Throw is permitted. Not only will all affected creatures run away from the wizard, they will move at their maximum movement rate for 2d6
minutes. Dragon Fear only affects humanoids. Animals, beasts and creatures immune to magical fear are impervious to the effect.
Magic

79

Harpy Song

Mimicking the song of this spell’s namesake, the caster inflicts 1 point of damage to all humanoid creatures (friend or foe) in the area of effect.
This damage is deducted from the victims’ Hit Points. In addition, the damaging effects continue each combat minute the caster chooses to

sing. Deaf creatures and animals are immune to the effects of the spell. When singing, the caster is unable to cast spells, but may still attack.

Major Shifting

Major Shifting allows the caster to transform herself into a large animal (bear, boar, or wolf). While altered, the character gains the benefits
associated with the animal type (attack methods, damage, etc.) and can converse with animals of similar species. In addition, the AV of the

wizard is equal to her current Magic skill level. Although she gains great benefits, she is unable to use skills, cast spells, or communicate with
humanoids. The caster may change form at will, though each change requires 1 full minute. Damage sustained while in animal form is
deducted from the caster’s Hit Points.

Protection from Beasts

Use of this spell prohibits animals and beasts having fewer than 50 Hit Points from attacking the wizard. Although an animal is permitted to

approach the caster, said creatures cannot injure the caster unless the wizard attacks them first. Humanoids and monsters (animals with more
than 50 Hit Points) are immune to the effects of the spell.

6th Level
Bestial Domination

This magic can control the mind of certain large animals (bear, boar, or wolf). When casting this spell, the Player must roll 1d100. If the score

is equal to or lower than the character's schematic table result, the spell is successful. The dominated creature serves the Beast Mage without
hesitation, surrendering its very life for that of its master. If the attempt is failed, the spell has no effect. Although the animal is loyal to the
character, it will not accept physical abuse or punishment. If the caster is cruel, the creature receives a Saving Throw vs. Magic and, if successful,
is no longer under the caster’s control. The Marda mage permanently loses 5 Spell Points for each animal that he actually dominates.

Dragon Scales

Dragon Scales cover the wizard with dozens of black, shiny scales. This protective covering increases the caster’s Armor Rating to 10 but does not
absorb damage from attacks. When the spell’s duration expires, the scales dissolve into wisps of black smoke.

Wings

When invoked, the wizard sprouts large, bat-like wings from his back, granting him the power of flight with a Speed of 8. The mage is able to

perform normal actions (e.g. casting a spell) while flying. A character suffering from the racial detriment Acrophobia is unable to use this skill.
80

Magic

7th Level
Bestial Mutation

More powerful than the 3rd level spell Animal Mutation, Bestial Mutation transforms a normal animal into a monstrous beast. When cast, the
Player must choose one form of mutation from the list below. This mutation affects the target animal until the spell expires. Since the spell does
not grant control of the animal, it is wise to use this spell on creatures that are already dominated.
Venom Sacks - gives the target animal a poisonous bite. With each successful hit, the creature inflicts its normal damage and forces its victim to
make a Saving Throw vs. Poison. If the Saving Throw is successful, the victim suffers no ill effect. If failed, however, the poison inflicts 1d4
points of additional damage. This damage is deducted from the victim's Hit Points.

Multiple Heads - causes the target animal to grow 1d2 additional heads, which can be used in melee combat. Each head has the same Attack
Value and damage potential as the original. All heads must attack the same opponent.

Increased Size - increases the size and mass of the animal by 100%. This doubles the target animal’s Hit Points and increases its damage by +4.

Insect Wave

When invoked, this spell summons a vast swarm of biting insects that form a circular wall around the caster. All creatures within the area of
effect suffer 4d6 points of damage, which is deducted from their Hit Points. After its initial attack, the swarm disperses.

8th Level
Transformation

Channeling the powers of this magic, the wizard changes into a Dragon, a beast capable of incredible destruction. When cast, the character's

body is mutated and altered. Her eyes become serpent-like. Her skin thickens and turns into leathery scales. Within a few brief seconds the
mutation is complete, and the caster is forever changed!
Once transformed, the caster gains all the characteristics and abilities associated with the monster (Attack Value, damage potential, movement

rate, etc.). The new Dragon has 200 Hit Points. Unlike other spells, the caster is able to increase this potential by expending additional Spell
Points at the time of casting. Each time the character pumps the spell, the Dragon gains +5d10 Hit Points. These points are permanent and
raise the creature's maximum potential. The caster immediately inherits the creature's savage mentality and aggressive tendencies, and has no
recollection of her past life, friends, or skills. The transformed mage is a danger to all creatures and may no longer adventure in a campaign
setting.

The character’s schematic table result determines the creature’s Armor Rating. In addition, there is a percentage chance of the caster retaining
her spell ability. When the spell is cast, the Player must roll 1d100. If the score is equal to or lower than the character's Intellect score multiplied
by two, the Dragon can cast spells! There are two limitations, however. First, the Dragon retains only 50% of the character's Spell Points.
Second, the beast is limited to casting Spikes, Spike Shower, Sonic Wail, and Venomous Spit. In this altered state, the Dragon does not require spell
components but is unable to increase the spells’ effects through additional Spell Point expenditures.
Since Dragons are inherently destructive creatures, any character casting this spell must be removed from the campaign. Although this ends a
character’s existence, it is the perfect way to be remembered!

Berethenu Knights

Berethenu Magic (a Divine Magic) is a spiritual belief that creates a
bond between the caster and his deity. Since the magic is granted
through prayer, the mage does not require components to manipulate
spells nor does he suffer the harmful side effects abundant in Pagan
Magic. Although immune to the dangers of magic, a character that
becomes a Berethenu Knight (as a warrior of this magic is called)
must dedicate his life to the beliefs and codes of the religion.

Furthermore, these disciplines must be followed precisely or else all
spell ability is lost until penance can be attained.

The three main principles of Berethenu (Poverty, Self-sacrifice, and
Honor), while just and moral, are difficult to follow. First, the Knight

must swear to donate portions of his wealth to an appropriate
institution. At low levels, this is equal to only a small percentage of

his monetary assets. As the cavalier advances in level, however, these
donations become more generous. Eventually the character is unable

to amass any significant personal wealth. Donations are given to places
of healing, orphanages, or other worthy charities. It is not uncommon
to find a Knight sponsoring a certain household or group. However,
the cause must be a valid and deserving one. The following table

illustrates the donation percentages that must be adhered to.
Lever

TITHInGc %

Self-sacrifice is a difficult challenge for the would-be Berethenu
Knight. The character must travel about healing the wounded, tending
to the sick and defending the helpless. He may not ask for (or receive)

payment for his services other than food, lodging, and other minor
necessities. This discipline is a cornerstone of the Berethenu religion.

A Knight must be willing to sacrifice his own life to defend others.
In order to accommodate this, Berethenu will convert a Knight’s
personal Hit Points into Spell Points. The ratio of exchange is

determined by the character’s level in the magic. It must be noted
that Hit Points exchanged into Spell Points may not be healed through

any method other than rest due to the spiritual nature of this
undertaking.

Leadership

Casting the Leadership spell, the Knight attempts to bestow a +1 Attack Value upon all friendly creatures within 30’. When

cast, the Player must

roll 1d100. If the score is less than or equal to his character’s schematic table percentage, the spell is a success. The AV modifier lasts

until the

spell expires. Note that functioning under the effects of the Leadership spell does not disqualify a character from earning credit toward skill
advancement. If the 1d100 score is unsuccessful, the spell has no effect.

Parrying

The Parrying spell has two effects. First, Parrying gives the recipient a +1 Armor Rating for the duration of the spell. Second, this spell
temporarily bestows the Parrying skill. Before the initiatives are rolled, the recipient may transfer up to four points from

his character’s AV to his

DV1 or DV2. Although it lessens the target creature’s offensive capability, it makes him harder for an opponent to hit. Once the spell expires,

all benefits are lost.

Resist Disease

By casting the Resist Disease spell, the Knight heightens the recipient's immune system. While affected, the recipient gains a positive modifier
when required to make Saving Throws ys. Disease. Even if a Saving Throw should fail, the character suffers only 1/2 the normal effect. The
effect of a disease is not felt until the duration of the spell expires. Paralysis (both the magical variety and the type inflicted by undead) is
considered a disease and is affected by the casting of this spell.

Resist Poison

‘This magic increases the recipient’s immune system to natural and magical toxins. For the duration of the spell, Resist Poison grants a positive
modifier toward Saving Throws vs. Poison. Even if a Saving Throw should fail, the character only suffers 1/2 the effect. The effect of any poison
is not seen until the spell expires.

Sight Restoration

Summoning Berethenu’s power, a Knight is capable of restoring sight to a creature blinded by magical or supernatural
means. When the spell
is cast, the Player must roll 1d100. To cure the blindness, the score must be equal to or lower than his character’s schematic

affected as well. When these undead are present in the area of effect, the Player must roll 1d100 (for each undead). If the result is equal to or
lower than his character’s schematic table percentage, the spell is a success. If the roll is failed, the spell has no effect upon the greater undead
target. The maximum number of undead that can be affected is determined by the caster’s area of effect.

Restore Health

Casting this spell, the Berethenu Knight may cure a creature suffering from disease, poison, or other affliction. When invoked, the Player must
roll 1d00. If the result is equal to or lower than his character’s schematic table percentage, the spell is a success. If the attempt fails, the spell has
no effect. Although the caster may attempt to cure the victim multiple times, each failed attempt reduces his chance of success by -10%. This
spell cannot cure insanity, or lost characteristic points caused by the Harmful Side Effects associated with Pagan Magic.

6th Level
Holy Word

Berethenu’s Holy Word spell causes physical damage to all undead creatures in the area of effect. The magic is strong enough to destroy Magouls,
Skeletons, and Zombies without fail. The maximum number of undead that can be affected is determined by the caster’s Area of Effect.

Mental Discipline

Strengthening a recipient’s mind, the Knight grants immunity to mind-affecting attacks (i.e. Doppelganger, Limris, Wind Whispers, Mind
Domination, Ego Meld, etc.). This protection lasts until the spell expires.

Rejuvenate

A powerful Enchanter may use his 6th level spell, Mental Draining, to steal characteristics, skills, and abilities from a hapless victim to

use in the

creation of magical items. As defenders of justice, Berethenu Knights find this treatment of mankind abhorrent. Summoning the powers of the

Rejuvenate spell, the Knight can restore the mind of the recipient and negate the effects of the Enchanter’s spell. If successful,

Rejuvenate

destroys the magical item and returns the victim’s characteristics, skills, and abilities. Note that if the Enchanter has already cast Solidify Magic
on the item, this spell has no effect.

Attaining high level, a Necromancer can cast the deadly spell called Rot. This 8th level magic causes a victim’s skin to decay and dissolve while
the victim is still alive. Taking great offense to this act of inhuman cruelty, a Knight can cast the Rejuvenate spell and cure the victim of the
effects of this diabolical magic.
In either of the above situations, the Player must roll 1d100. If the result is equal to or lower than his character's schematic table percentage, the
spell is a success. This completely heals the target creature. The Knight may attempt to heal a victim multiple times in the event of a failure,
though each attempt reduces the character’s Chance of Success by -10%.

Elemental Magic

Elemental Magic, a form of Pagan Magic, was created after Kitharu
(god of nature) was taken from Juravia. It harnesses and controls the
fundamental forces of nature, allowing a wizard power over the
elements. Elementalists (as a wizard of this magic is called) are able
to damage single enemies or large groups, transform themselves into
elemental forces, and bring great devastation in the forms of fiery
rain, lightning, and terrible storms.

This type of magic falls into the category of Attack Magic, and is the
most destructive form. A wizard harnessing this power is unable to

wear armor, and thus is vulnerable to physical attack. Fortunately,
the magic enables the user to manipulate the elements into various

forms of protection. This advantage, combined with the ability to
inflict severe damage and control nature, makes the Elementalist a
force to be reckoned with.
As is standard in Attack Magic, an Elementalist can increase his spells’
effects. This is done through the expenditure of additional Spell Points

at the time of casting. By choosing to “pump” a spell, the caster is

able to enhance one area (Range, Duration, Damage, Save Modifier,
or Chance of Success). The following chart displays the benefit of
increasing each variable,
Tyre:
RANGE:

Elemental
+15'

DvraTION:

+2, minutes

Damace:

+3 damage

SAVE MopIFIER:

-1 save

Success %:

+5%

Although “pumping” a spell can be beneficial, it can also be dangerous.
As a Pagan Magic, the wizard requires physical components to harness
and manipulate the magical energies. Each time an effect is increased,
there is a chance the wizard’s component shatters, causing him

physical damage. It is extremely important for the wizard to be
cautious. Each component (or talisman) is expensive and difficult to
obtain, and without the object a character is unable to cast spells.

There are ten different components used to manipulate Elemental
Magic. Each one allows the casting of a select category of spells
(Damage, Domination, Knowledge, Mutation, and Protection). Spells
between the levels of Ist to 4th require minor components while
spells between the levels of 5th to 8th require major components. If
the caster does not have a specific component, he will not be able to
cast that category of spell. Because components are expensive, a Player

should consider his character's spell selection carefully. This way, the
character doesn’t learn spells he doesn’t have the component to cast.

The following is a list of the various spell categories, components, and their cost:

Minor Protection Spells: Diamond - must be polished and carved with intricate designs. The component may be mounted on a broach, ring
or weapon, but the value of the stone itself must be at least 280 gold coins.

Minor Mutation Spells: Small Prism - must be made from polished glass (without a single defect). The value of this object is 160 gold coins.
Minor Damage Spells: Java Stone - rare stones that must be carved into intricate patterns resembling a sunburst. The stone itself has a value of
60 gold coins.

Minor Knowledge Spells: Meteorite -smooth and oval in shape. The workmanship must be perfect or it will not function as a component. The
cost is typically 220 gold coins.
Minor Domination Spells: Crystal Rod- having a length of at least 3'. The rod must be perfectly cylindrical and flawless. For such workmanship,
the value of the item is 100 gold coins.

into a small octagon. The cost to create such an object is 400 gold coins.

Major Knowledge Spells: mage Stone - must be perfectly smooth and transparent. The stone must be molded into a pendant, which is worn
by the wizard on a silver chain. The cost is 550 gold coins.

four inches in diameter and has a cost of 250 gold coins.

1st Level
Combustion

Using this magic, the caster creates a magical fire that burns in his hand. This fire ignites combustibles (oil flasks, cloth, etc.) and provides
illumination. The latter is very beneficial in dungeon exploration when a light source is required. Although the fire will ignite flammable
objects, it does not cause physical damage.

Fiery Touch

Casting this spell, the Elementalist can inflict damage by touching his victim. This requires the Player to roll 1d20. The character’s Attack Value
is determined by adding his current Magic skill level to any Dexterity modifiers. Since the spell only requires a simple touch, the caster only
needs to hit a DV 0. If the attack is successful, the victim suffers 1d10 damage, which is deducted directly from its Hit Points. If failed, the spell
has no effect.

Float

Using the powers of air, the caster is able to fall from great heights and not suffer damage. The rate of descent is equal to 30' per minute. If the
spell expires while the character is floating, the caster still suffers appropriate falling damage.

Ice Bolt

Using this spell the caster creates a long, spear-like shard of ice, which he launches at an intended target. The bolt automatically hits and inflicts
1d10 points of damage. One point is deducted from the victim’s Hit Points, while the remainder is subtracted from its Armor Points,

Predict Weather

Calling on her knowledge of nature, the caster gains information on the weather conditions for the following day. When cast, the Player must
roll 1d100. If the score is equal to or lower than the character’s schematic table result, the spell is a success. Precise knowledge of the next day’s

weather is gained. If the attempt fails, the spell has no effect. In addition to knowing the weather, the Elementalist knows if a storm is natural

or magically created.

Purify Water

Manipulating the properties of water, the caster can purify putrid, stagnant water and make it drinkable. When cast, the Player must roll
1d100. If the score is equal to or lower than the character’s schematic table result, the spell is a success. Purify Water eliminates any non-magical
diseases, poisons or impurities that existed in the water. If the spell attempt fails, the magic has no effect. In addition to cleansing the water of
most natural impurities, the spell has a 50% chance of destroying any microorganisms (Stamina Leech and Duvadin) that are living in the
water. The Referee should secretly make this roll to determine if the monster is destroyed.
102

Magic

Push

The Push spell conjures a strong gust of wind. When directed at a door or portal, the magic inflicts structural damage equal to 2 points per
Magic level of the caster. In addition to opening portals, the spell can be directed at a living creature. This causes 1 point of damage to the
target’s Hit Points. This damage can be increased through additional Spell Point expenditures.

Resist Cold

The Resist Cold spell protects the caster from any cold or frigid temperatures. While active, the caster receives 1/2 damage from any cold-based

attack (i.c. Frost Heave, Ice Shard, etc.). In addition, Resist Cold maintains the character’s body temperature at normal level regardless of
conditions.

Resist Fire

When cast, this spell protects the caster from hot, scalding temperatures. This protection decreases the damage resulting from any fire-based
attack (i.e. Fire Breath, Oil flask, etc.) by 50%. The spell also maintains the character's body temperature at normal level regardless of conditions.

Sand Squall

Calling upon the forces of earch and air, this spell surrounds the caster with a cyclone of blinding sand. Any creature that enters within 5' (melee
range) of the caster suffers a -2 Attack Value penalty. This detriment lasts until the spell expires. Although the victim's offensive capability is
reduced, the spell causes no physical damage.

Wind Listening

When Wind Listening is cast, the character can hear voices, noises, and other sounds from great distances. When invoked, the Player must roll
1d100. If the score is equal to or lower than the character's schematic table result, it is a success. The character hears all noise within a 60’ range,

can eavesdrop on conversations, hear noises behind doors, determine the number of voices speaking in a given area, and recognize familiar

sounds. If the roll fails, the spell has no effect. Characters already proficient in the Listening skill are permitted to add their percentage chance
for success to their Listening skill base. The duration of the spell lasts for 1 minute, and only a small amount of information can be gained.

2nd Level
Chilling Sphere

Chilling Sphere surrounds the caster and protects him from melee attacks. While the spell is active, any creature that enters within 5' (melee
range) of the caster suffers a -2 Attack Value penalty and subtracts 1 from its initiative roll. In addition, each creature affected by the spell suffers
1 point of damage each combat minute it is exposed to its effects. This damage is deducted directly from the creature’s Hit Points. The spell
affects any creature (friend or foe) that enters into its area of effect.
Magic

103

Earth Lore allows the caster to communicate with the earth in any given area. When this spell is used, the Player must roll 1d100. A score equal
to or lower than the character’s schematic table percentage is a success. The caster instantly gains information pertaining to the passing of
creatures, any secret areas within 20', and whether the earth in the area is stable. Knowledge gained by the spell is 100% accurate.

Fire Breath

Manipulating this magic, the caster is able to exhale a blast of fire on a single melee combatant. This attack automatically hits and causes 1d10
points of damage, which is deducted directly from the victim’s Hit Points.

Ice Burst

When Ice Burst is invoked, dozens of tiny icicles are launched toward a single target creature. These projectiles automatically hit and inflict
2d10 points of damage. Two points are deducted from the target's Hit Points while its Armor Points absorbs the remainder (when applicable).

Levitate

Summoning strong winds to support his weight, the Elementalist is able to move upward or downward at a rate of 30' per minute. The caster
is able to control his movements and still perform other actions. If the spell expires while the caster is still airborne, he suffers falling damage.

Purify Air

Purify Air cleanses the air the caster breathes. While the spell is active, the caster is immune to gases, spores, and other airborne impurities. This

spell protects the character from certain monsters and spells (Gray Mold, Musk, etc.).

Searing Touch

Similar to the first level spell Fiery Touch, this magic inflicts damage with a simple touch. The Player is required to roll a 1d20 and successfully
hit a DV 0. The Attack Value of the character is determined by adding his current Magic skill level to any Dexterity modifiers. If successful, the
spell inflicts 2410 damage, which is deducted from the victim’s Hit Points. If the attack roll is failed, the spell has no effect.

Spark Shower

When this spell is cast, it surrounds the character with an electrical current. This energy inflicts 1d6 points of damage to any creature (friend
or foe) that enters within 5’ (melee range) of the Elementalist. The damage is deducted from the victim’s Hit Points and is suffered each minute

the creature remains in melee range with the caster. In addition, the magic increases the caster’s Armor Rating by 1.
104

Magic

Water Walking

When invoked, this magic allows the caster to walk across the surface of any liquid as if it were dry land. Although able to move with relative
ease, he is unable to carry more than 100 additional pounds or else he will sink into liquid. The caster will assume no damage from walking
across acid, poison, or other such harmful substances.

Wind Vigil

When the Wind Vigil spell is cast, the mage gains knowledge of all creatures within the area of effect. Each minute, he is automatically aware of

the location and movement of all creatures, even if he cannot see them. In addition, the caster can detect hidden and invisible creatures. Since

the caster is completely aware of his surroundings, it is impossible for him to be surprised while the spell is active.

3rd Level
Alter Stone

Using this magic, the caster can mutate an area of stone however she desires. While the spell is active, the character can affecta5 x 5x5 cubic

foot volume of stone. She can cause pits to open, holes to close, doors to appear, etc. This mutation lasts until the spell expires, at which time
the stone returns to its original formation. While this magic affects the consistency of stone, it cannot be used to damage living matter.

Animate Fire

Using this magic, the Elementalist causes a normal torch or fire to ignite into a blazing inferno. This inferno (which reaches a height of 4') can
move and attack for as long as the caster concentrates. When engaged in melee combat, the fire has an Attack Value equal to the character's

Magic skill level. In addition, it only needs to strike a DV 0. Each successful hit inflicts 1d10 points of damage, which must be deducted from

the victim’s Hit Points. The fire automatically dissipates when the spell expires. The fire can be destroyed through combat as well. When
attacked, it has an Armor Rating of3 and can sustain damage equal to the caster’s Hit Points. As long as the wizard is concentrating, the fire has

movement rate of 20’ or can attack one time per combat minute. Since the character must focus on the magic, he is unable to perform any other
action.

Fiery Armor

Fiery Armor consumes the caster in a fiery blaze. Since the character’s image is barely visible in the crackling flames, his Armor Rating is
increased by +2. Any creature that enters within 5' (melee range) suffers 1d6 points of damage. This fire damage is deducted from the creature’s

Hit Points, Although consumed by magical flames, the caster is able to attack normally, cast spells and move about. In addition, for as long as
the spell is active, he suffers no damage from any fire-based attacks.

Magic

105

Frost Touch

Using this magic, the caster inflicts 1d10 points of damage with his mere touch, providing he successfully hits a DV 0. His Attack Value is

determined by adding his current Magic skill level to any Dexterity modifiers. Throughout the duration of the spell, it inflicts damage each

melee round the caster hits.

Ice Shards

By casting this spell, the Elementalist creates a long shard of ice that appears much like a spear or javelin. This projectile automatically strikes
its intended target and inflicts 3410 points of damage. Two points are deducted from the victim’s Hit Points while the Armor Points absorb the
remainder.

Pyrotechnics

Pyrotechnics engulfs the caster’s hands in blue flame. Merely by pointing his finger, the caster causes a victim to burst into flames. The target
creature suffers 3410 points of damage, which is deducted from the creature’s Hit Points. The Elementalist is not required to make a “to hit”
roll.

Tempest

The Zémpest spell protects the caster from projectiles. Throughout the duration of the spell, the wizard is impervious to non-magical missiles
(arrows, bolts, oil flasks, etc.) as these items are buffeted away by the powerful wind currents that surround him. In addition, small avian

creatures (e.g. Ebryns and Terricals) are unable to attack the caster while the spell is in effect. As the wind currents are so incredibly strong, the
caster receives a -4 Attack Value when attempting to employ missile weapons.

Wind Blast

When Wind Blast is invoked, the magic-user summons a powerful blast of wind centered on any location within the spell’s range. All creatures
within the area of effect suffer 2410 points of damage. Two points of damage are deducted from the victims’ Hit Points while the Armor Points
absorb the remaining damage (when applicable). Although the spell harms living creatures, it has no effect on inanimate objects.

Wind Whispers

This spell allows the Elementalist to create magical voices that only the target creature can hear. Although the caster can send messages via these
voices, he also has the option of creating disturbing, deafening sounds that interfere with combat and spell use. The target of these “harmful”
voices receives a -5 Attack Value throughout the spell’s duration and has a 20% chance per combat minute of being inflicted with mental
exhaustion. The target may make a Saving Throw versus Mind to avoid the effects of mental exhaustion. If the attempt fails, however, the
victim is unable to cast spells for that particular minute, since her concentration is disturbed.

Minor Damage

Invoking this magic, the caster shoots electricity from his fingertips and electrocutes a target creature. Each minute the caster concentrates, his

victim suffers 1d10 points of damage. Damage is deducted directly from the victim’s Hit Points. In addition to suffering damage, the creature

receives a -5 Attack Value and is unable to cast spells due to the intense pain caused by the electrocution. At any time, the wizard is able to
change his target creature, but is unable to perform any other action while the spell is active.

Elemental Shift

Minor Mutation

Additional SPTS, Duration, HSE

This spell allows the caster to meld his body into an element (earth, fire or water) and disappear. While in this altered state, he travels through

the element at a rate 30' per minute, is immune to all attacks, and is completely undetectable. If the caster is still melded when the spell expires,

he suffers 1d4 points of Hit Point damage due to the shock, and is expelled from the element at his current position.

Fog Cloud

This spell creates a thick, billowing fog that spreads outward around the caster. All creatures (friend or foe) caught in this cloud suffer the

expires, the fog dissipates and all negative modifiers are lost.

Magic

107

Frost Breath

Invoking this magic, the caster exhales a blast of frigid air which inflicts 3d10 points of damage to a melee opponent. The attack automatically
hits and the damage is deducted from the victim’s Hit Points.

Lightning

When the Lightning spell is cast, a single bolt of electricity explodes from the caster’s hands. The caster must hit his target's DV2. His AV is

equal to his Magic skill level plus his Dexterity modifier. Damage inflicted by this spell is determined by rolling 4d10. This damage is deducted

directly from the creature’s Hit Points,

Swirling Fire

Being consumed in a fiery inferno, the caster is protected from melee attacks. Any creature (friend of foe) that moves within 5’ (melee range)

of the character suffers 2d4 points of damage. This damage is deducted from the victim's Hit Points. In addition to damaging melee combatants,
the spell increases the caster’s Armor Rating by 4 points and offers a form of regeneration, healing 1 Hit Point of damage per combat minute.

Water Serpent

Using this magic, the wizard melds into an existing pool of water consisting of at least 20 cubic feet. While melded, the character loses his

physical form and becomes part of the liquid. This makes him completely undetectable and grants him immunity to all physical and magical
attacks. Movement is possible at a rate of 30' per minute.
At any time during the spell’s duration, the caster can attack a creature that is standing within 10’ of his pool. For each level in the Magic skill,

the caster creates one watery serpent that rises from the water and strikes at potential victims. The caster’s Attack Value (for each attack) is equal

to his current Magic skill level. Each successful hit causes 2d10 points of damage. Like most melee weapons, only 2 points are deducted from
the victim's Hit Points. The opponent's Armor Points absorb the remainder of the serpent’s damage. Although capable of inflicting serious
wounds, these serpents are vulnerable and may be attacked. Each one has a natural AR of 6 and suffers 1/2 damage from all non-magical
attacks. The serpents are immune to normal fire (e.g. oil flask). Any damage inflicted on a serpent is deducted from the caster’s Hit Points.

The caster may negate the spell at any time. If the water source is destroyed before the spell ends, the character suffers 1d8 points damage (to
his Hit Points) due to the shock. Throughout the spell’s duration, the caster is incapable of casting spells, using items, or performing skills.

Wind Snare

When the Elementalist casts this spell, he conjures a powerful cyclone of wind that traps a single target creature. While imprisoned, the target
is incapable of using missile weapons (bow, crossbow, javelin, oil flask, etc.), as the encircling winds are too powerful and buffet the projectiles

from their course. Creatures outside of the cyclone are likewise unable to attack the prisoner with missile weapons. Although normal weapons
are useless, magical attacks will have effect.

During the spell’s duration, the victim may attempt to break free of the cyclone. Attempting to leave the windy prison inflicts 1d10 points of
damage and only has a 50% chance of success. Failure indicates that damage was suffered and no escape was possible that minute. One point
is subtracted from the prisoner’s Hit Points, while the Armor Points absorb the remaining damage (when applicable). Once a victim escapes or
the duration expires, the spell is negated.
108

Magic

5th Level
Control Weather

When this magic is channeled, the Elementalist controls the weather patterns within the area of effect. He is capable of choosing from the
options below. Note, however, that it takes 20 minutes for the desired effect to occur.
Snow - the caster summons blinding snowstorms that pelt che area with three inches of accumulation per hour. In addition, the snow lowers

visibility in the area to 20', slows movement to 1/4 the normal rate, and destroys crops.

Rain - when summoned, torrential downpours flood the area with five inches of rainfall per hour. The dark, menacing storm clouds block out
all sunlight, reduce movement to 1/4 speed, and flood low grounds causing severe damage to structures.
Clear Skies - this option causes the sky to become clear, disperses all storms (magical or otherwise) in the area, and makes for calm weather.
If two elementalists invoke the spell simultaneously, the wizard with the higher Magic skill level will succeed in dominating the weather. The
weaker mage’s magic will simply fail.

Earthen Armor

Calling on the forces of earth, the Elementalist transforms his skin into stone. This mutation increases his natural AR by +1, making him more

difficult to hit. Each time the caster is attacked, the spell absorbs 10 points of damage but does not decrease in defensive abilities. Earthen Armor
cannot be destroyed. Since the caster’s skin is physically changed, his movement is reduced to 1/4 the normal rate.

Flesh to Stone

When this spell is cast, a swirling globe of gray energy is created that automatically strikes a creature standing within range. The victim suffers
severe pain and, although this does not inflict damage, its’ body is transformed into solid stone. The spell may be cast on any creature. Since the
creature has been turned to stone, it is incapable of movement and cannot perform any actions. It is impervious to all attacks, whether magical
or otherwise and does not sustain damage from poison, disease, blood loss, etc. When the spell expires the creature returns to normal. It is
important to note that the victim is entitled to a Saving Throw vs. Magic when the spell is cast, and if successful, the spell has no effect.

Ice Shell

When the Elementalist invokes this spell, it encases the targeted victim in a shell of ice. While within this shell the creature is impervious to all
attacks, magical and otherwise. The affected creature may perform normal skills, use items, drink potions, cast spells, etc. but cannot attack or

affect creatures outside of the shell. In essence, the wizard creates a prison of ice that is impossible to shatter. The spell may be cast on any
creature, including the Elementalist himself.

Immunity to Cold

This form of magical protection causes the caster to receive no damage from attacks that are cold-based (whether magical or otherwise).

from fire-based attacks (Flame Spirits, oil flasks, Swirling Fire, etc.). Even Dragon breath cannot harm an Elementalist protected by this spell.

Telekinesis

This spell allows the wizard to use the power of the winds to move objects, break down portals and inflict damage on potential enemies. By
concentrating on a target creature or object within 100’, the caster can perform one action each minute. Although he can alternate among the
three options, he cannot perform any other actions such as casting spells, attacking, etc.
First, the caster can move objects or creatures at a rate of 30' per minute. He can call things to his hands, repulse an enemy, or even lift a victim
into the air and then drop her. This mode of attack inflicts normal falling damage. Conversely, the caster can catcha falling victim and protect
her from taking damage, providing she is of acceptable weight. Second, the Elementalist can focus the power on a portal and inflict 5 points of
structural damage. Lastly, the Elementalist may opt to attack a target creature. This attack automatically hits and inflicts 1d6 points of damage,
increased by the Strength score of the spell. One point of damage is inflicted to the victim’s Hit Points while its Armor absorbs the remainder.

6th Level
Control Water

Invoking this spell the Elementalist can cause large quantities of water, to boil or freeze. Any creature exposed to boiling water suffers damage
equal to 3d6, while those in frigid water suffer damage equal to 2d6 for each minute of exposure. In both cases, this damage is deducted directly
from the victim's Hit Points. The wizard may control the water temperature throughout the duration of the spell. Creatures impervious to heat

will not suffer damage from boiling water. Likewise, creatures immune to cold will not be affected by freezing temperatures.

Fire Shell

Casting this spell engulfs the Elementalist in flames that burn continuously throughout the spell’s duration. These flames have several effects.
First, all non-magical missiles incinerate in the fiery shell and do not cause damage to the caster. Second, any creature attempting to physically

attack the wizard (e.g. Brawling skill) suffers damage equal to 1d10. This damage is deducted directly from the attacker’s Hit Points. Third, it

raises the caster’s AR by 5 points and, although it does not absorb damage, the protection does not decrease. The mage gains the ability to touch
melee opponents and cause them damage equal to 2d6 per attack. This requires the Player to roll 1d20, attacking a creature's DV2. The
character's AV is determined by adding his current Magic skill level to any Dexterity modifiers. This damage is deducted from the victim’s Hit
Points. Lastly, the caster heals himself at a rate of 1 Hit Point per minute.

Flame Departure

This spell causes the caster and surrounding area to burst into flames. Flame Departure inflicts 2410 points of damage to all creatures standing
within the blast area. Because it is fire damage, it is deducted directly from the victims’ Hit Points. The caster does not suffer any damage and
is magically transported to a desired destination, providing it is not farther than ten miles away (per level of the wizard). The caster can
transport one additional creature for every three levels of Magic skill.
110

Magic

Lightning Strike

With the manipulation of this magic, the Elementalist can create two bolts of lightning that shoot from the ground and cause damage to

selected targets. Each bolt inflicts 3d10 points of damage (deducted from Hit Points) and they can be focused on multiple targets, While this

energy can be used to cause damage to other creatures, the wizard may select himself as a target and heal his wounds through the magical powers
of the spell. Each bolt that is designated for the caster heals 2d10 Hit Points.

7th Level
Incinerate

One of the most damaging spells that an Elementalist can cast, Jncinerate causes severe wounds to any single creature within range. On casting,
the wizard inflicts 5d10 points of damage, which is deducted directly from the Hit Points of the victim. Creatures that sustain enough damage
to kill them are curned to ashes by the power of the spell.

Wind Violence

By casting this spell, the Elementalist summons hurricane winds that affect the area around her. These winds are strong enough to prohibit any

sort of missile attacks and cause all small flying animals (e.g. Avecki, Ebryns, etc.) to be buffeted away. Those creatures (friend or foe) that
remain inside the hurricane suffer damage equal to 1d10 each minute. One point is deducted from the victim’s Hit Points while its Armor
Points absorb the remainder. In addition, the victims suffer a -4 to their Attack Values. Although the spell offers protection, it has an offensive

dimension as well. Each combat minute the caster is able co inflict 3d10 points of damage to a single target creature. This inflicts 3 points of
damage to its Hit Points and the victim’s Armor Points absorb the remainder (when applicable). When employing this attack, the caster is
unable to perform other actions.

8th Level
Transformation

When a master of Elemental Magic invokes the magical powers of Transformation, he allows himself to be consumed by the elemental forces of
nature and dissolves. Although his body is destroyed, the caster’s intelligence and personality are scattered throughout the elements within the

spell’s area of effect. The wizard gains the ability to see everything within his area of dominance, retains the ability to cast spells anywhere his
powers reach, and can communicate with creatures as a soft whisper on the breeze. Once transformed, there is no method of damaging or
destroying him.

The Elementalist can cast any spell that he learned during his mortal life. Although he retains only a portion of his Spell Point potential, each
night he regenerates all the points used that day. His schematic table scores determine his area of effect, the length of time that he remains

sentient, and the portion of Spell Points he retains.

Once the spell expires, the wizard’s intelligence and personality blends into the elemental forces and he is totally destroyed. Areas that were once
dominated by transformed Elementalists, however, tend to have harsher climates and terrible storms. Because the caster is unable to move from

his defined area, he can no longer travel with his party members and must be removed from the campaign. Although this ends the character’s
adventuring career, it allows him to dominate his own area of the world. In the history of Juravia, only a handful of wizards have ever achieved

Enchantment Magic
When Dembria, goddess of enchantment, was forced to leave Juravia,
she left behind a cult of wizards. In the absence of their deity, these
magic-users sought to continue practicing their arts and created
Enchantment magic (a Pagan Magic). Through the use of physical
components, Enchanters can harness the powers of magic and use it
to create magical items, grant knowledge, and protect themselves
from attacks.
Unlike the limited duration of Attack Magic, an Enchanter’s spell

can last indefinitely through the expenditure of additional Spell Points
on a day-to-day basis. These additional points are referred to as

Maintenance Points as they maintain a spell’s effect. Each spell has a

schematic table that displays the number of points (per night)

required for the spell. Since the character regains Spell Points through
sleeping (a maximum of 20), he can maintain a number of spells
that require no more than 20 Maintenance Points. These points are

subtracted from the character’s Spell Points at the beginning of each
night. Keep in mind that the character cannot go into negative Spell

Points. If this should occur, the Enchanter must negate a spell (or
spells),
For example, an Enchanter with 28 Spell Points has six spells she
wishes to maintain. Assume it requires a total of 15 Maintenance
Points to keep her spells active. At the end of each night, she must
subtract the number of Maintenance Points (15) from her total Spell
Points (28). This would equal 13. If the Enchanter got sufficient

sleep, she would regain 20 Spell Points and would be at maximum
potential. In addition, all her spells would remain active. Assume,
on the other hand, that she did not sleep for eight hours on a given
night. The mage now only has 13 Spell Points and it takes 15 to

keep her spells active. Since the Enchanter cannot have negative
Spell Points, she would have to negate a spell (or spells) to maintain
a 0 or positive Spell Point value.

Although Enchanter spells vary dramatically from those of the Attack
Magic, Enchantment Magic still contains harmful side effects. These
effects are dangerous and can cause the magic-user to suffer

permanent draining of characteristics, physical damage, and possibly
death. In addition, an Enchanter is unable to wear any type of armor

‘ll
al

\

as it interferes with the constant flow of magic that allows him to
maintain his spells.
Using Pagan Magic, an Enchanter is required to utilize physical

components to manipulate his magic. Each spell requires a certain

mixture of ingredients. These components dissolve during the casting

of the spell. Because of this, Enchantment Magic is very expensive.

Furthermore, the casting of an enchantment is a long, drawn-out
process that takes 5 minutes per spell level to complete. If the wizard
is disturbed during this time, the casting is interrupted and the

component and Spell Points are used without effect.

Literacy

HSE, Maintenance Points, Number of Languages
The Enchanter can bestow the ability to read and write in different languages to a single humanoid creature. When cast, the wizard must specify

which languages are bestowed by the spell; once they are determined, the caster cannot alter them. Although the magic allows the recipient to
read and write a language with 100% accuracy, the spell does not allow the character to speak the tongue. Casting this spell requires two ounces
of gold dust (20 gold) and one glass lens (5 gold).

Magic Lock

This enchanted lock can be placed on any object chest, door, or gate. With the casting of the spell, the wizard creates a magical lock or alters a

pre-existing one, making it difficult for a character to open it with the Open Locks skill. This reduces the opener’s chance ofsuccess by 10% per

level of the Enchanter. Even if the object is opened, the spell is negated and the object will magically close and lock again within 3d6 minutes.
The components for this spell are two ounces of gem dust (50 gold) and a wax trinket in the form ofa key (5 gold).

Mystic Robes

two ounces of silver dust (10 gold) and a ground turtle shell (1 gold) to cast the spell.

Night Vision

secretly make 1d100
rolls when lies are being told to the Enchanter. If the result is equal to or lower than the character's Magic Skill Level multiplied
by ten, then the
Enchanter is aware of the lie. It is important to note that the Enchanter can only detect falsehoods that are spoken directly
to him (e.g. an

answer to his direct question). The ingredients for the spell are four ounces of gold dust (40 gold) and one

glass bead (1 gold).

Enchanted Vestment

__ Armor Points, HSE, Maintenance Points
Enchanted Vestment magically alters the caster’s robes and turns them into armor. Although the spell does not offer an increase
to the Enchanter’s
Armor Rating, it does absorb damage like armor. Furthermore, each night the Armor Points granted by the spell are magically
restored. To cast
this spell, the character needs four ounces of silver dust (20 gold) and a piece of leather treated with tree sap (4 gold).

Friendship
HSE, Maintenance Points, Save Modifier

When this spell is cast on a humanoid creature, it affects the target's mind. With the initial casting, the victim is entitled
to a Saving Throw vs.
Mind at +2. This Saving Throw value is further modified by the Enchanter’s schematic table result, If the save is successful,
the spell is negated.
If the save is failed, the target creature views the caster with great respect and as a close friend (equivalent to a 100% Reaction
Roll). For as long
as the spell is active, the victim will aid the Enchanter to the best of his or her ability.
Although the spell creates a close friendship, it does not allow the caster to take advantage of his

“friend”. Each time the victim is asked to do
something against his nature or to surrender items of value, he will be entitled to another Saving
Throw vs. Mind. Furthermore, each such

instance increases the victim’s Saving Throw by +1; this increase is cumulative. If the victim makes it’s Saving Throw at any
time, the spell is
instantly broken, In addition, the victim will hold a great hatred for the Enchanter for a period of 3d20 days,

When the Enchanter casts this spell, he is able to read runes that were created through magical spells
(e.g. Runes, Curse, Runes ofPain, Glyph o

the type of spell that is on any given

object. This spell requires six ounces of gold dust (60 gold) and one glass lens (5 gold).

ESP
HSE, Maintenance Points, Range
ESP allows the caster to read surface thoughts of a humanoid creature, though only vague impression

s can be read. Whenever the caster focuses

ona single humanoid creature that is standing within range, she can read the target's general attitude (anger,
friendship, etc.). This determination
requires 1 full minute in concentration. Although able to read thoughts, this spell does not enable the
caster to communicate telepathically nor
does it allow her to gain knowledge from the target's mind. Since ESP is a passive “attack”, the victim
is completely unaware of the caster’s

prying. To cast this spell, the Enchanter requires five ounces of gold dust (50 gold) and two

doses of Nagdu blood (20 gold).

Glyph of Fire

Casting this spell, the Enchanter can place a magical glyph on any portal (i.e. door, window, gate, chest,
etc,). Whenever the portal is opened,
the glyph erupts into flames and inflicts damage to any creature standing within 10', The damage
inflicted, as determined by the caster’s
schematic table result, is deducted from the victims’ Hit Points. As long as the spell is maintained, the magic
will return to the glyph in 24 hours
and will explode again if disturbed. The spell requires six ounces of gem dust (150 gold) and a single feather
from a phoenix (50 gold).

Transference

This spell transfers the personal characteristics of the Enchanter to another humanoid creature. Although this lowers the caster’s Strength,
Stamina, Dexterity, or Awareness, it increases the target’s statistics. This transfer grants any modifiers associated with the increase (damage, Hit

Points, Attack Value, and Defensive Value) for as long as the wizard maintains the spell. Likewise, the caster suffers any penalties assoctated with
the reduction in his statistics. The schematic table determines the maximum characteristic values the Enchanter can transfer. At no time can
this value be equal to more than half the Enchanter’s characteristic score. The ingredients for the spell are six ounces of gold dust (60 gold) and
several drops of the caster’s blood.

4th Level
Draining

Draining is similar to Transference, except that the Enchanter drains characteristics (Strength, Stamina, Dexterity, or Awareness) from other

humanoids and bestows them on herself. It is the caster’s decision on which statistic she steals; the schematic table determines the amount

transferred, The victim of the spell is entitled to a Saving Throw vs. Mind. If successful, the spell has no effect and is negated. If failed, the

victim loses the appropriate characteristic score and suffers any modifiers or negative penalties associated with the loss, while the Enchanter
gains the points and any resulting modifiers. When the Enchanter decides to discontinue the spell, both the Enchanter’s and the victim's

characteristics return to normal. Although capable of stealing characteristics, the Enchanter may not drain more than 1/2 ofa victim's characteristic

value. The caster’s characteristics may never rise above a maximum of 16.0 points. The component for the spell is eight ounces of gem dust (200
gold) and a silver rod (10 gold).

Glyph of Pain

When cast on an object, Glyph of Pain magically inscribes it with runes that cause pain to any creature that touches the affected item. Damage
inflicted is equal to 1d4 points, which is deducted from the victim’s Hit Points. This damage is suffered each minute the object is being held.

The wizard requires eight ounces of gem dust (200 gold) and three drops of phoenix blood (150 gold) in order to manipulate this spell.

Mind Cocoon

While the Mind Cocoon spell is in effect, the Enchanter’s mind is completely shielded against any form of Mind attack (e.g. ESP, Telepathy, Wind
Whispers). The caster also gains an increase to his Saving Throw against the domination attack of a Limris, Doppelganger, or Enchanter

(Draining, Ego Meld, etc.). The component for this spell is four ounces of silver dust (20 gold).

Mutate

When this spell is used, the Enchanter can change her physical appearance to resemble any humanoid race (between the heights of 3' to 8’).
This disguise is completely undetectable. Appearances can be altered as many times as needed, with each transformation taking 1 full minute
of concentration. Although capable of looking like any race, the caster does not gain the racial abilities associated with the race, nor does he gain

the ability to speak its language. The caster requires eight ounces of gem dust (200 gold) and a drop of Limris blood (20 gold).

Magic

Sleep

When cast on a humanoid creature, this spell causes the target to fall into a deep, dreamless sleep and remain unconscious until the spell is

negated. The victim is entitled to a Saving Throw vs. Magic. If successful, the spell has no effect. If failed, however, the creature instantly is
affected by the spell and falls asleep within 2d4 minutes. If at any time the victim is wounded during the trance, the spell is negated and the
creature will awaken. The materials necessary to cast to spell are eight ounces is gem dust (200 gold) and five pinches of fine sand (5 gold).

Telepathy

While the spell is active, the Enchanter is able communicate telepathically with another creature, regardless of the caster’s ability to speak the
target creature’s racial tongue. In addition to communication, the caster can read the mind of the target creature and gain knowledge. Since this

is an active probe, the victim is aware that Télepathy is being used but will not necessarily know by whom. Probing a creature’s mind is more

difficult. For each minute of concentration, the caster has a 20% chance of finding the appropriate information that she is seeking. Creatures
with Mind Protection (e.g. Dunnar, Limris) are immune to this spell. During telepathic communication the wizard is unable to perform other
actions. The ingredients necessary for this spell are eight ounces of gold dust (80 gold) and a copper wire (3 gold).

5th Level
Blades

‘This incantation may be placed on any type of one-handed melee weapon. While in effect, the Enchanter is able to control the weapon with her

mind, allowing it to attack creatures that come within the spell’s range. The weapon fights with an Attack Value equal to the wizard’s current

Magic skill level and inflicts normal damage. As with normal weapons, the affected weapon can sustain damage (notches); however, if the spell

is negated the weapon instantly dissolves. Not only can the wizard use this weapon to defend herself from enemies; she has the ability to control
1 weapon per Magic skill level (though each one must be enchanted with the spell). Thus a Gth level Enchanter could have 6 different one-

handed weapons fighting in her defense. It requires complete concentration to use this spell and, while the weapons are being used to attack,
the caster may not perform other actions. This powerful magic requires 10 ounces of gem dust (250 gold) and any one-handed weapon.

Craft Item
ei HSE, Maintenance Points

This spell is the first step in the process of making a magical item. The Enchanter is required to inscribe the object with runes and glyphs. This
is a slow, painstaking process that requires up to three weeks to complete. Once the target vessel is suitably prepared, the mage must cast Craft
Item on the target item, causing the writing and symbols to glow brightly for several hours before vanishing. The caster is required to invest
Maintenance Points to keep the item’s integrity intact. Discontinuing the maintenance of the item causes it to shatter.
This spell is only the first of three steps necessary to create items of power. Through the use of the 6th level spell Mental Draining, the Enchanter
can transfer powers from willing and/or unwilling donors to the object. This imbues the item with a skill, characteristic, or spell that benefits

the user. After the desired power is transferred to the item, the 7th level spell Solidify Magic is used to make the power permanent. Only then

can the Enchanter discontinue the maintenance of the spell and remove the points from the object. The materials necessary to cast this spell are
10 ounces of gem dust (250 gold) and special inks (50 gold) that are used to inscribe the item with runes.

Invisibility
HSE, Maintenance Points

Through the manipulation of this magic, the caster gains the power ofinvisibility. Not only does the caster gain surprise, but her

attacks are

always made against her melee target’s DV2. Creatures attempting to fight the caster receive all the penalties associated with Blind Fighting.
Creatures that can see invisible objects do not receive any negative modifiers. The Enchanter is able to become visible and invisible at will. Each
change requires 1 minute of concentration. The spell requires 10 ounces of gem dust (250 gold) and a sprinkling of Dungwala ashes (20 gold).

types such as healing and protection. Magic Resistance does not negate a spell that is already in effect on the wizard prior to casting. This magic
requires 10 ounces of gem dust (250 gold) and three spores ofa Power Moss (15 gold).

Power Glyph
HSE, Maintenance Points

With the casting of this spell, the Enchanter can inscribe various patterns on a single object (door, weapon, etc.) and cause it to become

enchanted. The glyph drains 5 SPTS from all magic-users that pass within 20’. The victim is aware of the draining and will continue to suffer
its effects each minute he remains in the area. There is no Saving Throw versus the effects, and only the caster is immune. The glyph does not

affect magical items. The caster does not gain the Spell Points drained by the glyph. The materials needed to invoke this spell are 10 ounces of
gem dust (250 gold) and five spores from a Power Moss (25 gold).

Skill Runes

Using this spell, the Enchanter can transfer up to 2 skill slots into a target item. This knowledge (including the caster’s skill level and percentage

base) is instantly granted to any creature that holds the item, but only for as long as it is possessed. If the spell is discontinued, the item dissolves

and the knowledge granted by the spell is forgotten. Note that the Enchanter loses his knowledge of the skill for as long as the spell is in effect.

‘Ten ounces of gold dust (100 gold), a few drops of the caster’s blood, and a single object are required in order to manipulate the spell.

This spell must be cast upon a specially-designed statue carved from stone and inscribed with various runes and glyphs.
The process required
to create such a sculpture takes five months of labor and is very expensive. When the magic is invoked, the Guardian spell allows
the object to
move, fight, and follow the commands of the caster. Since it is not intelligent, a Guardian is typically used as a sentinel
that protects an
Enchanter'’s area from intrusion. It can attack twice per combat minute with its blunt fists, each successful hit inflicting 2d6

must be filled with 10
doses of animal blood (20 gold). The prepared iron heart must then be placed inside a statue carved from stone, the
construction costs of which
averages 2,000 gold coins.

Invulnerability
HSE, Maintenance Points

—_——

Placing this spell on a single object (weapon or shield), enchants the item and makes it impossible to damage. A shield that is protected
by this
incantation still absorbs damage from attacks but is not actually damaged itself, This means that the shield’s defensive rating does not
decrease.
A weapon that is enchanted cannot sustain notches, even from magical spells. The effects of the enchantment last until the caster discontinues
the spell. At that time, the object crumbles to dust. Due to the small surface area of this enchantment, armor may not be protected
by the
Invulnerability spell. The components required to cast this spell are 12 ounces of gem dust (300 gold) anda piece ofa Mulkrog
shell (150 gold).

Mental Draining

Mental Draining is the second step in the process of creating magical items. Only after the Enchanter has cast the Sth level Craft Item
spell on
an object can this spell be manipulated. Calling on the powers of enchantment, the magic-user can drain the skills, characteristics and/or
individual spells from a willing or unwilling donor and transfer the power into the item. This transference automatically

succeeds if the target

creature is willing. Unwilling victims are entitled to a Saving Throw vs. Mind. Success indicates that the spell has no effect. Failing
the save
means the victim immediately loses the power. Characteristic draining will affect modifiers, Hit Points, etc, Skills that are stolen are
forgotten,
but the skill sloc is still forfeited. Individual spells are erased from the targer’s mind and he is unable to relearn it despite any attempt.
Once the
power is transferred, the item gains the skill, characteristic or spell ability for as long as the Enchanter maintains both spells (Cyzft
Item and

Mental Draining). If either spell is discontinued, the item dissolves and the victim regains his stolen abilities,
Characteristics — grants the holder an increase to the particular characteristic. In the case of the first six

characteristics (Strength, Stamina,

Intellect, Insight, Dexterity, and Awareness), the Enchanter is capable of stealing .3d10 points from his victim. When dealing with Speed,
Power, or Luck, only 1d2 points can be transferred using the Mental Draining spell.

Skills — steals the skill, skill level and base percentage that the donor possessed prior to draining. The user cannot increase an already

skill with the object, nor can he advance in the proficiency. However, the skill granted does not require a skill slot(s).
Spells — contains a particular spell that was stolen from the victim. Each item created with this type of power

existing

possesses 6d10 charges and, once

depleted, becomes useless. When dealing with spells, the Enchanter steals all the victim’s knowledge including Range, Duration, Damage,
etc.
Although possessing the victim's spell categories, the enchanted item does not contain Harmful Side Effects, nor does it require
the use of
components, Furthermore, the spell cannot be maintained, even if the user is an Enchanter.,
Note that a magical bond connects the item with the donor. If the victim is the recipient of a Berethenu Knight’s Mind Restoration

bond is severed and the item is destroyed. The spell requires 12 ounces of gem dust (300 gold) and a single root from
126

Magic

spell, the

a Skill Moss (20 gold).

Placing this enchantment on any type of smooth reflective surface (e.g. mirroy, glass, pool) creates a scrying device for the Enchanter. This

device can be used to gaze on any creature that the Enchanter can visualize in his mind (the target’s name must also be known), regardless of the

distance between them. Knowledge of the victim’s immediate surroundings, conversations and actions are readily seen within the misty surface

of the device. The magic-user can also cast certain spells (Curse, Friendship, Sleep, and Mind Domination) on the target creature through the
magical link. When the wizard stops concentrating, the scrying object reverts to normal. Note that the item remains enchanted for as long as
the spell is maintained. It requires 12 ounces of gold dust (120 gold) and a single diamond (50 gold) to cast the spell.

7th Level
Mind Domination

When this spell is cast, the Enchanter attacks the mind ofa humanoid creature and tries to dominate its thoughts. The victim must have a lesser
Intellect score than the caster or else the spell automatically fails. If che Enchanter has a higher Intellect score, the victim is entitled to a Saving
Throw vs. Mind. A successful save indicates that the spell has no effect. If the save is failed, however, the victim becomes the servant of the

Enchanter. Dominated creatures lose all self-control and personality, becoming mere drones that follow the wizard’s commands without

question. The domination lasts as long as the Enchanter maintains the spell. Once discontinued, the victim regains its personal identity but

does not remember anything that occurred while under the effect of the Mind Domination spell. In order to cast this magic the Enchanter needs
14 ounces of gem dust (350 gold) and two teeth from a Limris (100 gold).

Solidify Magic

The last step in creating magical items, Solidify Magic permanently drains the Enchanter ofSpell Points. Sacrificing these Spell Points allows the

wizard to stop maintaining the Craft tem and Mental Draining spells. The item is permanently empowered with the stolen abilities. This spell
dissolves the link between the donor and the magical item; even if the Enchanter dies, the item remains enchanted. Due to this fact, evil-

hearted Enchanters sometimes seek to kill the donor of the skill, attribute, or individual spell to ensure the item’s continued existence. Casting

this spell requires 14 ounces of gem dust (350 gold), several drops of the caster’s blood, and a bloodstone (150 gold) that must be crushed and
sprinkled over the item.

8th Level
Ego Meld

Casting this spell on a humanoid creature creates a magical link between the target and the Enchanter. Using this link, the caster can transfer

his own personality, Intellect, Insight, Power, Luck and skills to the body of the victim. The victim’s mind, intelligence, etc. are likewise

transferred to the Enchanter’s former body. This transfer of egos is permanent and enables Enchanters to extend their mortality by stealing the
bodies of younger, healthier victims. Note chat physical characteristics (Strength, Stamina, Dexterity and Speed) will not transfer between
bodies. There are two main detriments that the Enchanter faces when using this spell. The first is a 1% chance per full point of the target's

Intellect that the spell fails. This requires the Player to roll 1d100. If the score is equal to or lower than the percentage chance, the caster and

target go permanently insane due to the mental conflict that occurs during the transfer. The second detriment is that the Enchanter permanently

loses Spell Points, the number of which is determined by the wizard’s schematic roll. The spell requires 16 ounces of gem dust (400 gold), a pint
of the blood from both the caster and the victim, and a large emerald worth at least 1000 gold coins. This object is used to hold the Enchanter’s

ego during the transfer.

Grom Warriors
Grom Magic (a Divine Magic) is a bond connecting the Warrior of

the religion with his deity. Although imprisoned in Mulkra, Grom

continues to grant his followers magic in exchange for servitude.
Because of his master’s divine influence, a Grom Warrior does not
need components to cast spells, nor does he suffer from the Harmful
Side Effects abundant in Pagan Magic. Since the character receives
benefits from the religion, Grom expects complete obedience. Any
variance from the god’s codes or beliefs results in the immediate loss
of imagical powers. Since Grom is incapable of forgiveness, there is
no method for regaining spell ability. His religion is based on the

principles of Personal Glory, Selfishness, and Pride.

Personal Glory is the cornerstone of Grom’s religion. A Warrior must

continually prove his strength through combat. Each time the
character kills an adversary (whether NPC or Monster), he carns a
“kill”. In order to advance in Magic skill level, the character needs to
reach 100% in his Magic skill base and attain enough kills to appease
the god of war. Without meeting both conditions, no advancement

is possible. There are two important factors to remember when

recording kills. First, the Grom Warrior must inflict 100% of the

damage necessary to kill the adversary. If another creature, character

or spell inflicts even 1 Hit Point ofdamage, the kill does not count.
Also, the number of kills required for advancement increases as higher
levels are attained. These kills are non-cumulative (between levels).
Kitts For AbVvANCEMENT

The table on the following page illustrates the number of kills each
monster represents.
The second belief of the religion is Selfishness. Grom Magic allows a

Grom Warrior to heal only himself. This is accomplished by
exchanging Spell Points for Hit Points. In no circumstances can this
restore the health of another creature. The ratio of the transfer is
illustrated on the table below.
LeveL

SreLt Points

Hit Points

Pride js the third belief of the Grom Warrior. There are certain codes a Warrior of Grom must follow. Unlike a Berethenu Knight that suffers
harsher limitations as he advances in level, a character following the Grom religion has a static list of regulations. Breaking even one

laws results in the immediate and permanent loss of magic. These codes can be found on the following page.

Unlike Pagan Magic, a Grom Warrior may only learn spells that are equal to or lower than his current Magic skill level. For example,
Grom Warrior can only learn Ist, 2nd, and 3rd level spells.

It is not difficult to learn Grom Magic. A character need only enter a temple or religious area dedicated to the war god and call upon Grom’s

power. Eager to increase his following, the Magic skill is divinely implanted in the character's mind. But just as easily as it is granted, Grom can
strip the knowledge away!

Four KILLs

* The Referee must use discretion in determining the amount of kills a Grom warrior receives. Obviously, a warrior that is 6th level

in the short

sword is worth more than a man-at-arms who is Ist level. In addition, a wizard skilled in Necromancy magic who has attained 10¢h level would
be worth more than a seasoned warrior, These NPCs should range between | to 10 kills depending on their levels and abilities.

+ Dragons and Hydras are worth 20 kills for every 100 Hit Points. Thus, an ancient dragon could be worth more than 60 kills. Alchough these

Victory Above All Else! - A character may not run from melee combat as it is a sign of cowardice. This does not prohibit leaving
a
large battle, providing that all personal adversaries are slain.
Let Each Man Prove His Own Strength! - A Grom Warrior cannot attack a creature's DV2 for two reasons.
First, since the

adversary is already engaged, it is not worth a kill to the Grom Warrior. Second, Grom believes that each person
should be strong
enough to fight. Those who require help are weak and should die.

Earn Respect and Recognition! - A character must acquire kills and appease Grom's appetite for bloodshed. The Warrior must
acquire at least five kills per year.
Honor Grom! - On specific days, Grom Warriors gather in large groups to honor the war god. In turn, each one stands and
shouts his victories, hoping to impress Grom and earn his respect. All Grom Warriors are required to attend these religious
ceremonies. If attendance is not possible on the specific days in question, a Grom Warrior must successfully invoke the Ist level

The Enlarge spell augments the caster’s height, making him larger than man-sized. While under the effect of the magic, the character is
prohibited from using small weapons or riding steeds. He may however attack once per combat minute with two-handed weapons, may use the

Parrying and Final Blow skills while employing large weapons, and is immune to the Assassination skills (Melee and Missile). Although

Fear

Channeling the powers of Grom, the caster can inflict a sense of overwhelming terror in a single creature. This spell forces the recipient to make
a Saving Throw vs. Fear or else suffer a -4 Attack Value when fighting the caster. The character’s schematic table roll affects this Saving Throw
(either upward or downward). If the save is successful, the spell has no effect.

Fumble

The Fumble spell causes the target creature to lose its manual dexterity. When cast, the victim is required to make a Saving Throw vs. Magic or

else drop whatever item it was holding. In addition, before the creature can react, the Grom Warrior has the opportunity to use the Weapon
Stomp skill (if applicable). If the save is successful, the spell has no effect. Remember that the recipient's AV must be recalculated if the victim

loses its weapon.

Grom’s Weapon

Summoning divine aid, the Warrior of Grom creates a temporary weapon (of any type) to use in combat. This weapon inflicts +1 damage (to

the victim’s Hit Points) per hit and cannot notch. Furthermore, the caster is unable to drop the weapon (i.e. rolling a “1” when attacking, being
the victim of the Fumble spell, etc.). The weapon, which is considered non-magical, disappears when the spell expires.

Minor Harm

Minor Harm inflicts actual damage to the target creature. This damage is deducted directly from the target's Hit Points despite any armor worn.
The victim is not entitled to a Saving Throw.

Proclaim

The Proclaim spell allows a Warrior to honor Grom without having to attend a religious ceremony. Although the spell enables the character to

meet religious requirements and advance levels (when applicable), the god of war does not always listen. When the spell is cast, the Player must
roll 1d100. A score equal to or lower than the character’s schematic table result indicates a success. A failure indicates that Grom has ignored the
caster. In this case, no level is gained and the requirement for honoring the war god on religious days is not met. Keep in mind, failure to

successfully cast this spell on religious days results in the breaking of the religion’s code and the immediate, permanent loss of spell ability!

Rage

Channeling Grom’s anger, a Warrior is capable of increasing his Strength characteristic for the duration of the spell. This magical enhancement
affects the Warrior, regardless of his height and build limitations. Although capable of giving him an exceptional strength, the spell will not raise

a character past 12.0. The spell has the potential to increase the damage inflicted by melee weapons, but offers no benefit to characters that
possess a Strength of 10.5 or greater.

Magic

135

Termination

The Termination spell grants the Grom Warrior a limited proficiency in the Final Blow skill. While affected by the magic, the caster automatically
attempts the skill each time he drops an opponent to zero or negative Hit Points in melee combat. When this occurs, the Player must roll

1d100. A score equal to or below the character’s schematic table result is a success. This means the victim is irrevocably dead. A failure indicates
the victim is still alive (though unconscious and perhaps in negatives). If the character is already proficient in the Final Blow skill, the magical
percentage is added to his pre-existing base. Remember that the Warrior is not eligible for advancement credit if his normal skill base has been
magically increased.

2nd Level
Blood Lust

When a Warrior is reduced to negative Hit Points, he normally falls unconscious and continues to sustain damage as he bleeds to death.

When

affected by the Blood Lust spell, however, a Warrior will continue to fight until he reaches -15 Hit Points. While in effect, the Grom Warrior
does not sustain damage due to blood loss. Although the Warrior’s bleeding is temporarily halted, the character may still take damage and, if

sufficient wounds are inflicted to reduce the Warrior to -16 Hit Points, he immediately dies! When the spell expires, the character falls
unconscious and begins taking damage from blood loss. Appropriate healing is required if the Grom Warrior is to survive.

Forget

When the Forget spell is cast, the Warrior attempts to erase a Weapon skill from the mind of the target creature. Although this erasure is not
permanent, it lasts throughout the duration of the spell. When cast, the Player must roll 1d100. If the result is equal to or lower than the

character’s schematic table result, the spell is a success. Immediately, the victim of the spell forgets his Weapon skill level. This affects his Attack
Value, providing he had skill in the weapon. If the attempt failed, the spell has no effect.

Frenzy

Frenzy increases the caster’s attacks per minute by 1, allowing him to attack more frequently. For example, a longsword (usually permitted 1
attack per combat minute) is increased to 3 attacks every 2 minutes. Since the spell is focused on the caster (not the weapon), its benefits are

received regardless of the weapon used. In addition, the warrior is still eligible for credit toward Weapon skill advancement because

Value remains unmodified.

Gaze Evasion

When engaged with a creature that has a dangerous gaze (e.g, Cavasha and Medusa), the Grom Warrior is able to defend himself
via this spell.

When cast, the protection granted is equivalent to the Gaze Evasion skill. Each combat minute, before the initiatives are rolled, the Player must
roll 1d100. If the score is equal to or lower than the character’s schematic table result, the spell is a success. For that combat minute
the caster
may fight, suffering only a -2 AV, and, in addition, is immune to the creature’s gaze. If the character is proficient in the Gaze Evasion
skill, this

schematic percentage is added to his existing skill base. In this case, he receives no credit toward skill advancement. If the attempt fails, the

character is subject to the full effects of the gaze.

success and the target weapon is instantly destroyed. Remember, the victim's

target weapon does not break but still suffers one notch.

Wound Closure

Certain attacks inflict wounds that remain open, causing the victim to continually bleed (Terrical, spells, etc.). When a Warrior
invokes the Wound Closure spell on himself, it causes such wounds to close. In order to achieve this, the Player must

of Grom

roll 1d100. If the result is

equal to or lower than the character’s schematic table percentage, the spell is a success. Failure indicates the wound remains open and the
character continues to suffer damage.

3rd Level
Blindness

This spell allows the caster to inflict blindness upon a single target creature. To accomplish this, he must successfully touch his victim. This
requires the Player to roll 120. The character's Attack Value is equal to his current Magic skill level added to his Dexterity modifiers. Since the
spell only requires a simple touch, the character is required to strike a DV 0. If the attack fails, che spell has no effect.
Once the caster successfully touches his victim, the Player is required to roll 1d100. If the result is equal to or lower than the character's

schematic table percentage, the magical attack. succeeds. The victim is blinded for the duration of the spell. Blinded creatures

receive all the

negative modifiers associated with Blind Fighting, including a -10 Attack Value and loss of Shield Rating and Awareness modifiers for defense.

Although the blindness will end when the duration expires, it may also be cured through the casting of the 2nd level Berethenu spell, Sight
Restoration.

Deafen

Some monsters use sound to cause damage or other harmful effects (e.g. Harpy and Mul-Hound). To protect himself against such creatures,

Destroy Armor

The Destray Armor spell causes damage to a single suit of non-magical armor, This damage is permanent
and may reduce the target’s Armor
Rating, affecting the wearer's DV1 and DV2. If the armor does not have sufficient points to
absorb the damage inflicted by the spell, it is
destroyed. Under no circumstance does this spell injure living creatures!

Divine Harm

Similar to the Ist level spell, Minor Harm, the damage inflicted by Divine Harm is deducted directly from the target’s Hit
Points. Although the
same in damage potential, Divine Harm may be cast from a distance. There is no Saving Throw vs. the effects of the
spell.

Fury, another strength inducing spell, increases the caster’s Strength characteristic, regardless of his height and build limitations,
When praying
for aid, the caster gains his strength modifier for the duration of the spell. This may affect his damage inflicted with melee
weapons. Since the
maximum score attainable is 13.7, this magic offers no benefit to characters possessing a Strength score of 12.1 or greater.

Glory

Some monsters cannot be hit by non-magical weapons (e.g. Limris and Dungwala). A Warrior of Grom, however, can invoke
this prayer when
fighting such creatures. As long as the spell is active, the magic allows the caster to hit these monsters using any
normal weapon type, including

his fist. Although it allows him to hit, the spell does not affect his Attack Value.

4th Level
Accelerated Death

Calling upon Grom, the Warrior surrounds himself with an aura of pain. Any creature that is engaged with the caster in
melee combat suffers
1 Hit Point of damage per round. The spell increases the amount of damage suffered through blood loss. Any creature
that falls into negative
Hit Points must subtract 3 Hit Points per minute for as long as they remain in the area of effect. This effects both friend
and foe. The spell is
powerful enough to negate the 1st level Berethenu spell Prevent Death, but will not affect creatures protected by the Sth level
Cloak ofLife spell.

Assassination

Casting this spell, the Warrior temporarily gains the Assassination, Melee skill. In addition to inflicting more damage with

the character has a chance of automatically killing his humanoid victim. At the beginning of each

each successful hit,

combat minute, before the initiatives are

rolled, the Player must decide if his character is attempting to assassinate. Like the skill, there is a -5 AV penalty associated
with this action.
Should the attack be successful, the Player must then roll 1d100. If the result is equal to or lower than his schematic table
percentage, it is a
success and the target creature dies. If the attempt is failed, the character inflicts additional damage (pre-determined
by his schematic table roll),
138

Magic

If the caster already knows the Assassination Melee skill, then casting this spell increases his knowledge. In this case, add the character’s chance
of assassination (2% per level of skill) and the additional damage modifier (+1 per skill level) to the spell’s schematic table results. Remember,
the character does not receive credit toward advancement since his skill was magically augmented.

Bleeding

Using Grom’s power, this spell causes the humanoid target to bleed continuously from its ears, nose, and any open wound. This bleeding causes
1 Hit Point of damage each minute until the spell expires. The damage cannot be stopped without magical assistance. Binding kits will not heal
damage inflicted by the spell. The victim is entitled to a Saving Throw vs. Magic and, if successful, the spell has no effect.

Greater Harm

More powerful than the 1st level spell, Miner Harm, this spell inflicts serious wounds. Although the caster is not required to touch his victim,

the target must be within 5’ (melee range). The damage inflicted is deducted from the victim’s Hit Points and no Saving Throw is permitted.

Repair Armor

This spell allows the caster to mend armor through magical means. This does not require the Field Repair skill, repair kits, or tools. The repair
is permanent. Although the spell repairs Armor Points, it cannot increase a suit of armor above its maximum Armor Point potential. In
addition, if the spell is cast on a suit of armor that is already destroyed, it has no effect. Due to the selfish nature of Grom, this magic can only

be used to repair the caster’s armor. Since Grom dispenses the magic, repairing the armor of non-worshippers is impossible.

Weaken

The Weaken spell can be placed upon one humanoid creature standing within 5' of the caster. This magic automatically lowers the Strength
characteristic of the victim, which may affect its melee damage potential. There is no Saving Throw against the spell.

5th Level
Despair

Casting Despair surrounds the Warrior with an aura of sorrow that lowers the combat effectiveness of all creatures standing in the area of effect

(friend or foe). Those affected by the spell suffer a -5 AV and -2 initiative modifier until they leave the area of effect or until the spell expires.

Empower

The Empower spell grants the Warrior a magical Armor Rating. This protection affects both his DV1 and DV2 and remains constant for the
duration of the spell. If the caster already possesses an Armor Rating greater than the schematic result, the spell offers no effect until the caster’s
armor is damaged enough to lower its protection value. Although the spell protects the Grom Warrior like armor, it does not absorb damage.
Magic

139

Malice

Malice heightens the caster’s combat effectiveness by increasing his Attack Value. This makes it easier for him to hit in combat situations and
affects any weapon the character wields. Since the spell augments the Warrior’s ability, he does not receive credit toward skill advancement while
the spell is active. Also, if the character is skilled in Parrying, he cannot transfer these magical points to his DV1 or DV2.

Ogre Strength

Channeling Grom’s anger, a Warrior is capable of increasing his Strength characteristic. This allows him to reach a maximum of 15.5 (regardless

of height and build limitations) and may affect his melee damage potential. In addition, when the caster is attacking with his fist the damage
inflicted is increased to 1d6.

Venom

When Venom is cast, it coats the Warrior's weapon with a poison that inflicts additional damage. Each time the character successfully hits, the
poison inflicts +4 actual damage, which is deducted from the victim's Hit Points. Unlike the 2nd level spell, Poison, this spell does not weaken
with use. The damage modifier remains constant until the spell expires. However, if the caster drops his weapon (rolls a “1” on his d20 attack
roll) the spell is negated. Since Grom dispenses the magic, attempting to cast this spell on another character's weapon will result in failure.

6th Level
Agony

Agony inflicts severe damage to a single creature standing within range of the spell. The damage is deducted from the victim’s Hit Points,
regardless of its armor. There is no Saving Throw vs. the spell’s effect.

140

Magic

Grom’s Word

Calling on the wrath of Grom, this spell inflicts damage to everyone standing within the area of effect (friend or foe). All creatures (including

undead and the supernatural) suffer actual damage equal to 1 point per Magic skill level of caster. This damage must be subtracted from Hit

Points and cannot be restored via binding kits.

Unholy Armor

Unholy Armor protects the caster from all non-magical attacks. Although it does not affect his Armor Rating or absorb damage, only magical

weapons and spells can damage him. This protection lasts until the spell expires.

7th Level
Giant Strength

Giant Strength grants the Grom Warrior a Strength score of 17.5 (regardless of height and build limitations), This increase grants the caster +6
damage with melee weapons, increases the damage he inflicts with his fist to 1d8, and allows him to break down doors and portals with relative

ease. The effects last until the spell expires.

Regenerate

Using this spell, the caster’s wounds are healed at an accelerated rate. Each minute, the Warrior of Grom heals 2 Hit Points. In addition, severed

appendages are reattached and open wounds are sealed (eliminating damage due to blood loss). The magic will even continue to function if the
character is dropped into negative Hit Points. The spell will not allow the character to surpass his maximum Hit Point potential.

8th Level
Vengeance

The Vengeance spell transforms the caster into a monstrous weapon. First, it increases his Attack Value by 10. This affects any weapon the caster

wields, making it easier for him to inflict damage in combat. The second benefic is an increase to the Warrior’s Hit Points. These magical points
will raise a character above his maximum Hit Point potential and are deducted first when damage is suffered. The spell also increases the
Warrior's height to larger than man-sized status, allowing him co use the Parrying and Final Blow skills even when using larger weapons (maul,

two-handed sword, etc.). This change also increases his attacks per minute with these weapons to one attack every combat minute. The Warrior
of Grom becomes immune to all non-magical attacks similar to the 6th level spell, Unholy Armor. Lastly, while the spell is active, the character
is immune to all diseases, fear-based attacks, and poisons (natural and otherwise). The caster is even immune to spells that mimic these effects

(e.g. Paralysis and Rot).

Although the Vengeance spell offers great benefits to the caster, his mental faculties are affected by its magic. Throughout the duration of the
spell, the caster will attack the nearest creature (friend or foe) without thought or hesitation. Due to the magical AV bonus, the Warrior will not
gain credit toward advancement in his Weapon Skill.

Necromancer Magic

When Necros (god of death) was banished from Juravia, his followers

developed a Pagan Magic dealing with the unnatural and unworldly.

Necromancy (as it has come to be called) mimics the powers and
abilities of the undead. Wizards who study this Black Art are feared
and persecuted. Able to create zombies, skeletons, and other
abominations, the mage uses these creatures as servants or guardians.

This type of magic falls into the category of Attack Magic, and is

considered the most diabolical form. Although not as damaging as
Elemental Magic, a character is able to wear padded armor and still
cast spells. Having the ability to inflict damage to a single foe or
group, along with the ability to animate undead and grant himself

undead characteristics, makes the Necromancer a powerful adversary.

As Necromancy is an Attack Magic, a wizard can increase his spells’
effects. This is done through the expenditure of additional Spell Points
at the time of casting. By choosing to “pump” a spell, the caster is
able to enhance one area (Range, Duration, Damage, Save Modifier,

or Chance of Success) of the spell. The following chart displays the

benefit of increasing each variable:

Tyre:

Necromancy

RANGE:

+10'

DuraTion:

+5 minutes

DAMAGE:

+2 damage

SAVE Mop irier:

-1 save

Success %:

+10%

Although altering a spell can be beneficial, it is also dangerous. Like
all Pagan Magic, the wizard requires physical components to harness
and manipulate the magical energies. Each time a spell is “pumped”,
there is a chance the wizard’s component shatters, causing him
physical damage. Because of this, it is important for the wizard to be

wary. Each component (or talisman) is expensive and difficult to

obtain, and without the object a character is unable to cast spells.

There are ten different components that manipulate Necromancy

Magic. Each one allows the casting ofa select group ofspells, which

are broken down into categories (Damage, Domination, Knowledge,
Mutation, and Protection). Spells between the levels of Ist to 4th
require minor components, while spells between the levels of 5th to

8th require major components. If the caster does not have a specific
component, he will not be able to cast that category of spell. Since
components are expensive, a Player should consider his character’s

spell selection carefully. This way, the character doesn’t learn spells
he doesn’t have the component to cast.

The following is a list of the various spell categories, components,
and their cost:

Minor Protection Spells: Black Onyx - can be fashioned into a
broach, pendant or ring, but must weigh a minimum of ten ounces.

The stone must be pure onyx and can only be wrought with items

crafted from silver. The normal cost for such a stone and its subsequent
workmanship is 210 gold coins.

146

Magic

Minor Mutation Spells: Bone and Ashes — are necessary to cast Minor Mutation spells. A single polished bone, inlaid with silver runes, must

be placed in a velvet sack containing the ashes of an incinerated body. These items cost 120 gold coins.

Minor Damage Spells: Silver Knife - a ceremonial blade that cannot be used in combat. Once tainted with blood, the item becomes useless

as the pure silver is contaminated. The item usually costs 45 gold coins.

Minor Knowledge Spells: Polished Skull inlaid with silver markings - may be mounted on a staff or hidden in a pouch. It does not need to be

humanoid. The skull and intricate markings typically costs 165 gold coins.

Minor Domination Spells: Cold Wrought Iron - can be fashioned into a ring, weapon or other object. Although this could raise the cost of
the component, the value of the metal itself must be 75 gold coins.

Major Protection Spells: Black Onyx Pentagram - this object must be crafted into the form of a pendant or charm and must be inlaid with

silver runes. The component must be touching the flesh of the caster when the spell is cast or else it will not function. The average cost for the
materials and craftsmanship is 525 gold coins.

Major Mutation Spells: Silver Medallion - must be made from pure silver and wrought into the shape of a skull. Two small onyx beads must

be placed within the eye sockets. If the item is ever exposed to sunlight, its value as a component is destroyed. The cost for manufacturing this

item is 300 gold coins.

Major Damage Spells: Sharpened Bone - must have a minimum length of four feet. One end must be carved into a fine point. The outside
of the bone must be polished. The item must be hollowed and filled with the ashes ofa powerful undead creature (e.g. Vohl or Vampire). The
as a staff,
construction of the item requires a skilled artisan and costs 110 gold coins. Although it is a spell component, the item can be passed off

cane or small walking stick.

Major Knowledge Spells: Glass Orb - must be finely crafted and be perfectly smooth. Once created, it is filled with the ichor ofaVohl and
sealed with a stopper made of cold iron. The object can be carried or worn on a chain or cord. The cost is 400 gold coins.

Major Domination Spells: Necromer Blood- must be kept within a container crafted from Human bone. The blood can never be removed

from the container or else the component is destroyed. The cost is 190 gold coins.

1st Level
Commune with Dead

Casting this spell, the Necromancer gains information from the dead. Although the caster can ask three questions, the deceased body can only
respond in one-word answers. Furthermore, its knowledge is limited to things it had known during life.

Feign Death

Using this spell, the caster appears dead. The magic stops the character's heartbeat and breathing and pales his skin. This disguise will fool
humanoids, animals, and undead. While the spell is active, the caster is aware of his surroundings but is unable to move, speak, or cast spells.

The effects can be negated at any time.

Lesser Animation

When the wizard casts this spell on a dead body, it causes the skin and muscles to rot away and dissolve. Within moments the target is
transformed into an undead creature known as a Skeleton. This undead follows the character’s commands without thought and serves until

destroyed. The Necromancer suffers a permanent -0.1 Stamina loss for each undead he creates.

Pain

The Pain spell causes physical wounds to a target creature. When cast, the Player is required to roll 1d20. Since the spell requires only a simple
touch, the character must successfully hit a DV 0. The mage’s Actack Value is determined by adding his current Magic skill level to any
Dexterity modifiers. A successful hit inflicts 1d8 points of damage, which is deducted directly from the victim’s Hit Points. If the caster misses
the attack roll, the spell has no effect.

Repel Undead

Repel Undead protects the caster from Magouls, Skeletons, and Zombies. Each time the wizard encounters one of these undead creatures, the
Player must roll 1d100. A score equal to or lower than the character's schematic table percentage indicates a success. This means the undead

creature ignores the caster. A failed roll means the spell has no effect. A d100 roll is made for each undead creature the caster encounters during
the spell’s duration. In addition, if the caster inflicts damage to an affected undead, the spell is negated with respect to that specific creature.

Resist Poison

Resist Poison increases the caster’s immunity to natural poisons. This spell grants the Necromancer a +3 to Saving Throw vs. Poison. This
increase lasts until the spell expires.

148

Magic

Skeletal Bolt

This spell creates a long, pointed shard of bone that automatically strikes a target creature standing within range. Damage inflicted by the
attack is equal to 1d8. One point is deducted from the victim's Hit Points while its Armor Points absorb the remaining damage (when
applicable).

Undead Chill

Summoning the bone-chilling powers of the supernatural, this spell protects a Necromancer in melee combat. All creatures (friend or foe)

standing within 5' (melee range) of the caster suffer a -2 Attack Value penalty. This effect lasts until the spell expires.

Undead Sight

This spell changes the optical senses of the character, allowing him to see 90' with Undead Vision. Until the spell expires, the caster can see in
total darkness. All creatures, including undead and hidden, can be seen when using this spell. In addition, the character can see hallways and
doors, making it possible to travel through dungeons without a light source.

2nd Level
Animation

When cast on the body of deceased humanoid, the Animation spell causes it to rot and decay. Within moments, the corpse is completely
transformed into the undead creature known as a Zombie. This undead follows the commands of the caster without thought or hesitation until
destroyed. The creation of this undead is costly to the Necromancer and she suffers -0.2 points of Stamina for each Zombie that is made. This

Stamina loss is permanent.

Bone Skin

This spell changes the caster’s normal skin to a skeletal texture. Although it only raises the wizard’s Armor Rating by 2 points, it protects him

against bladed weapons. When such weapons are used against him, the Necromancer only suffers 1/2 damage (similar to Skeletons). Although
protected from pointed weapons, the character still suffers full damage from blunt ones (club, hammer, etc.).

Cold Image

When the magic-user casts this spell, ic causes her body temperature to decrease. In addition, there is a 50% chance (which the Referee must

roll) that Skeletons, Zombies and Magouls that encounter the Necromancer ignore her, believing she is another undead. This percentage
chance must be rolled for each individual creature encountered while the spell is in effect. When used in direct illumination, the spell offers no

effect against creatures employing Normal Vision. Creatures using Heat Vision will believe the caster is undead due to the caster’s altered
thermal signature.
Magic

149

Jagged Bone

This spell creates a large, jagged bone that the caster launches from his fingertips. Automatically striking the target creature, this magic inflicts

damage equal to 2d8. Two points of damage are inflicted to the creature's Hit Points while its available Armor Points absorb the remainder.

Leathery Skin

Leathery Skin changes the caster’s normal skin into a hard, leathery substance. In addition to raising the wizard’s Armor Rating by 2 points, the

spell protects him from blunt weapons. Like a Zombie, the Necromancer only suffers 1/2 damage against melee attacks employing these

weapons. Bladed weapons (axe, dagger, sword, etc.) inflict normal damage.

Resist Turning

When the Necromancer casts this spell on his undead, it increases the creature's resistance to being turned. Throughout the duration of the
spell, the affected undead is immune to the Berethenu Knights 1st level spell Minor Turning. The schematic table result determines the number
of undead that can be affected per spell.

Respiration

Respiration stops the respiratory system of the Necromancer, eliminating the caster’s need to breathe. By doing so, the caster becomes immune
to gases, spores and other airborne hazards that must be inhaled to cause damage. The caster can even be submerged in water or other liquids
and have no fear of drowning.

Skeletal Control

This spell controls the skeletal system of another living creature. The victim of the attack receives a Saving Throw vs. Magic and if successful,
the spell has no effect. If the save is failed, the target becomes rigid and is unable to perform any actions during that particular combat minute.

Each minute the caster continues to concentrate, the creature remains paralyzed. After the first minute, there is a 25% chance that the spell is

negated. This chance increases by +10% each combat minute thereafter. The Referee should roll 1d100 each minute to determine the effects.
While the caster is concentrating on the spell, he is unable to cast spells, attack or even move. The spell only works on humanoid creatures and,
while active, all attacks made against the victim and the Necromancer are against their DV2.

Torture

With a mere touch, the caster inflicts 2d8 points of damage directly to the victim’s Hit Points. The caster must touch his victim. To do this, the

Player must roll 1d20 and successfully strike a DV 0. The character’s Attack Value is equal to his current Magic skill level added to any Dexterity
modifiers. If the caster should fail to hit his opponent, the spell has no effect.

150

Magic

3rd Level
Bone Shards

Casting this spell, the Necromancer creates a spear-like bone with a sharpened tip. This shard automatically hits and inflicts 3d8 points of
damage. The first 2 points of damage are deducted from the victim's Hit Points, while its available Armor Points absorb the remainder.

Command Undead

When the Necromancer employs this spell, he can issue a command to an undead creature (Skeleton, Zombie, Magoul, or Giant Skeleton).
Unless the creature makes its Saving Throw vs. Magic, the command (up to three words) must be followed. The undead creature will follow

these commands without fail until the spell expires. This magic is only effective against undead not already dominated by the caster.

Decay

Decay causes the intended victim's skin to deteriorate and dissolve. Each combat minute the target suffers severe pain as it begins to rot. This
inflicts 1 Hic Point of damage until the spell expires, the victim dies, or the caster is slain. In addition, the target suffers a -3 AV. If the victim
dies by means of the spell, its body will decay and transform into a Magoul within 72 hours. This creature does not serve the Necromancer!

Draining

This spell allows the Necromancer to steal 1d4 Hit Points from an undead creature and transfer them to himself. When the spell is cast, the

target undead creature suffers damage equal to the amount stolen by the wizard. Although healed by the spell, the magic cannot place a

character above his maximum Hit Point potential.

Greater Animation

The Greater Animation spell creates a Giant Skeleton from the bones of several dead humanoids. When these powers of Necromancy are

invoked, the character loses -0.3 Stamina since he must transfer his own life force to the abomination. This loss is permanent. The Giant
Skeleton will serve the caster throughout its existence and follow the wizard’s commands without hesitation.

Minor Transformation

Transforming her body into a minor undead creature, the wizard gains the attack forms, damages, special abilities, and detriments associated
with his new form (Magoul, Skeleton, or Zombie). The Necromancer is immune to poisons and is completely ignored by undead creatures. In

addition, while in undead state, the character may still employ spells and skills, and all knowledge is retained. It is important to note that minor
undead are Photosensitive and suffer damage from sunlight. The caster suffers this detriment as well. Although able to transform as often as

desired during the duration of the spell, each mutation requires 1 full minute.

Magic

151

Repair Undead

This spell enables the caster to repair damage suffered by his undead servants. Although capable of healing his creations, the Necromancer
suffers 1 Hit Point of damage when the magic is cast. This small sacrifice restores 2d8 Hit Points to any one undead creature.

Torment

Torment surrounds the caster with a sphere of billowing fog that causes respiratory damage to humanoids (friend or foe). Any creature that

enters within 5' (melee range) of the mage suffers 1d4 points of actual damage for every minute it is exposed.

4th Level
Bestow Intellect

Bestowing this undead magic, the caster permanently transfers a portion of his own Intellect characteristic to an undead creature. This transfer
gives his creation intelligence that allows it to learn skills. Each time the spell is cast, the Player must roll 1d100. A score equal to or lower than
his schematic table result equals a success. Instantly, the Necromancer is drained 0.1 Intellect, which translates to 1 point of Intelligence for his
undead creature, generating 1 skill slot. The undead then requires three months of training to learn a skill and subsequently advances like a
living character. Regardless of the proficiency learned, the creature starts with a 15% base. The spell may be cast upon the same creature as often
as desired. Regardless of the creature’s intelligence it will continue to serve the caster. If the caster’s d100 roll is failed, the spell has no effect.

Mist

Mist allows the caster to change himself and his belongings into gaseous form. For the spell’s duration, he is able to seep through small openings
(e.g. cracks and holes) at a movement rate of 20' per minute. While gaseous, the wizard is impervious to all attacks, is unable to pick up items,

cannot cast spells, or even communicate. He may change in and out of mist form as many times as desired, each change requiring | full minute.

Paralysis

When this spell is cast, the Necromancer inflicts a melee target with the disease known as Paralysis. The humanoid victim is entitled to a Saving
Throw vs. Magic. If the save is failed, the target loses one point of Speed each minute. Once a Speed of 0 is reached, the victim cannot perform

any actions. This helplessness lasts for 1 minute per Magic skill level of the caster. While paralyzed, all attacks are made on the victim’s DV 2.

Skeletal Hand

This spell strips the skin from the caster’s hand, leaving behind a skeletal appendage. Each combat minute, the Necromancer can touch a

creature and cause damage. This requires the Player to roll 1d20 and successful attack a DV 0. The character's AV is equal to his current Magic

skill level added to any Dexterity modifiers. A successful hit inflicts 1d8 points of damage directly to the victim’s Hit Points. If the caster misses,
the spell has no effect for that combat minute. When employing this attack, the caster cannot perform any other actions.
152

Magic

Stamina Blast

When this spell is cast upon a living creature, it erodes the victim's life force. When cast, the Necromancer inflicts 1d8 damage. As long as the
caster concentrates on his enemy, the spell continues to blast the target with harmful energies. Each minute thereafter, the victim suffers an
additional 2 Hit Points of damage until such time as the caster sustains damage, the creature escapes the spell’s range, or the spell expires. While
concentrating, the Necromancer is unable to perform any other actions, and all attacks against him are made on his DV2.

Undead Domination

Casting this spell, the Necromancer gains control of an undead creature (Giant Skeleton, Magoul, Skeleton, or Zombie). The initial chance of

success is equal to 50%, but this can be increased through additional Spell Point expenditures. The Player must roll 1d100 to determine if the

spell has any effect. If the score is equal to or lower than the character’s chance, the domination succeeds. The undead creature is instantly
dominated and follows the wizard’s commands without exception. If the roll is failed, the spell has no effect. Gaining control of undead is

detrimental to the caster. Each time it is performed, the mage permanently loses -0.3 Stamina.

5th Level
Abomination

When Abomination is cast on a dominated Skeleton or Zombie, it mutates the undead target and increases its ability to attack. First, the target
creature grows two additional arms. Instead of hands, these appendages end in bone scythes that each inflict 1d6 damage in melee combat.

Augmented by these weapons, the target’s number of attacks per minute is increased (a Skeleton has three attacks, a Zombie has four). The spell

also increases the affected creature's Attack Value by 5 points and its Hit Points by 30. When the spell expires, the affected undead will revert
to normal.

Ichor

When Ichor is cast on the blood of a recently deceased humanoid, the Necromancer can imbibe the fluids and gain knowledge and life. The

mage must first roll 1d100. If the result is equal to or lower than the character's schematic table score, the spell is a success, Instantly, the wizard

learns all about the deceased creature, including its name, the skills it knew, its homeland, and its friends. The other effect is that the draught
heals the wizard 2 Hit Points. In order for the spell to have any effect, the deceased creature must have been alive within 6 hours of the casting

of the chor spell. Only one spell may be cast on each dead humanoid. All other attempts will end in failure.

Instruct Undead

This magic transfers Percentage and Leveled skills from the Necromancer to an intelligent undead creature. When the spell is cast, the wizard
must choose the proficiency he wishes to transfer and permanently subtract 15% from its base. The skill is automatically given to the undead
recipient. The undead not only gains the skill with a 15% base, but can increase its base with use. The only stipulations to this spell is that the
undead target must be intelligent (see the 4th level Bestow Intellect spell) and have sufficient skill slots necessary to learn the proficiency.

Repel Living

Casting this spell, the Necromancer surrounds himself with a sphere of protection that causes agony to living creatures. Although the wizard
may be attacked via missile weapons and magical spells, living creatures are repelled and cannot enter the spell’s area of effect. Creatures within
the area of effect will seek to flee as quickly as possible, taking the quickest route available. Note that undead are not affected by this spell.

Sanctify

When the wizard invokes this spell, it surrounds him with an unholy aura that shields all undead creatures within the area of effect. This
protection, which lasts until the duration expires, negates the effects of the Berethenu Knight’s Minor Turning, Major Turning, and Holy Word
spells. Also, any Berethenu Knight that enters the sphere suffers 1 Hit Point of damage per minute due to the unholy aspect of the magic.

Skeletal Armor

Using the powers of Necromancy, this spell encases the caster in bone-like armor that protects him from harm and absorbs damage. The armor
increases the character's AR to 7 (the equivalent of plate armor). Like normal plate armor, the skeletal armor possesses 70 Armor Points. Also,
the bones that protect the Necromancer are covered with sharp barbs that cause damage. Each physical attack on the caster (e.g. biting) causes

1 Hit Point of damage to the attacker. Even though the armor absorbs damage, the amount of protection it offers does not decrease.

Undead Link

This spell creates a magical link between a single undead creature and the Necromancer. For the spell’s duration, the wizard can see through the
eyes of the undead, speak through its mouth, and has the ability to cast spells and use skills through its body. Since this requires perfect

concentration, the magic-user cannot perform other actions, Due to his trance-like state, the caster is unaware of his own surroundings. All
attacks against the caster are made against his DV2. Note that this spell does not grant control of the undead to the caster.

Casting this spell, the character transforms herself into a ghost-like apparition. While in this altered state, she is impervious to all non-magical
weapons, retains her ability to cast spells, and gains an increase to her Armor Rating of +5. Not only a defensive spell, the character gains a

damaging touch. Each combat minute, the Player must roll 1d20, using the character’s Magic skill level (with Dexterity modifiers) to determine

the Attack Value. Since the Necromancer does not need to actually hit her victim, the character is required to strike a DVO. If successful, the

victim sustains 1d8 points of damage to its Hit Points. The effects last until the spell expires. Although the caster is ghost-like in appearance, she

is unable to pass through solid objects.

When invoked, the Screaming Souls spell summons the twisted and misshapen souls of the dead. These ghastly images scream and wail as they
fly forth from the caster and automatically strike their target(s), disappearing on contact. The Necromancer summons three souls with this
spell. They may be directed at one or more targets. Each one inflicts damage equal to 3d8 points. Three points of damage are deducted from the

intelligent creature to be their leader. No matter what occurs, the transferred undead will follow the commands of the Necromancer above all
others.

Damnation

This spell surrounds the caster with the shadow of death, cloaking the area in a grayish mist. Although visibility is not reduced, all living

the creature’s Hit Points. Only the caster and the undead are immune to the effects of the spell.

Life Drain
Additional SPTS, HSE, Save Modifier

Using this spell, a Necromancer drains the life force from a humanoid creature and permanently increases his own Stamina characteristic. The

spell requires the wizard to successfully touch his target victim. When cast, the Player must roll a d20. The character’s Attack Value is determined

by adding his current Magic skill level to any Dexterity modifiers. Since the spell requires contact with the victim’s skin, the caster must strike

at his opponent’s DV2. If successful, the victim is entitled to a Saving Throw vs. Death. A failure indicates the victim loses .1d6 points of

Stamina. These points should be deducted and any modifications to the victim’s Hit Points should be made immediately. In addition, the

Necromancer’s Stamina score permanently increases by the same number of points and the mage should make all necessary corrections as well.

A successful Saving Throw negates the draining effects, but the victim suffers 1d8 points of damage to its Hit Points instead of the Stamina loss.

Seeking immortality, egocentric Necromancers have discovered a magic that allows them to “live” forever in undead form. Casting this spell,

the Necromancer permanently transforms himself into the horrid undead creature known as a Vampire (see Monsters). Gaining all the benefits

of the undead creature, the wizard surrenders his own personality for immortality. Although he retains some of his memories, which are seen as
vague dreams, his thoughts are bent on the destruction of all living things. His magical powers are not forgotten, however, and he can still cast

spells up to 6th level ability. Although the Necromancer gains immortality in this altered state, his undead form can still be killed.

Humanoids

It would be nice if every monster could be classified as either good or evil. If this were true, whenever a party of adventurers came across a group
of Higmoni, they could attack them in good conscience knowing that the creatures were up to no good. However, in the Forge: Out of Chaos
role-playing system that is not the case. There is no such distinction between good and evil in living creatures, As in reality, morality always
exists in shades of gray. It is usually wise for adventurers to speak with the humanoids they encounter instead of just drawing swords and
rushing into battle. By speaking first, it may be possible to avoid combat and keep both armor and weapons intact. In fact, it is even possible
that the humanoids are friendly and will agree to aid the party with information or supplies.
While individual creatures always have their own distinct attitudes and personalities, the majority follow the racial characteristics that are
described in the following monster descriptions. Therefore, while it is possible to find a Higmoni warrior living peacefully in a Human village,
the majority of the race is violent and pugnacious.

Undead

The term Undead refers to an abomination created from the decomposing remains of a humanoid. These creatures are usually mindless, show
no mercy toward their victims, and attack without hesitation. They are created through the magical spells of Necromancers or other horrid
monsters that tamper with the forces of life and death. These unholy creatures serve their creator until they are destroyed. They do not require
sustenance, sleep, or air. They have Undead Vision that allows them to see in complete darkness. In addition, certain types gain immunities to
non-magical weapons or suffer less damage from sharp or blunt ones (e.g. Giant Skeletons, Skeletons, and Zombies).

Even though undead creatures gain several benefits, they are unable to enter direct sunlight without suffering damage or other harmful effects.
When exposed to direct sunlight, the undead suffer damage equal to 1 Hit Point per minute. Since undead are no longer living creatures, their
wounds do not heal. Once they reach 0 Hit Points they are instantly destroyed. The only way an undead creature’s Hit Points can be restored
is through the magical spell Repair Undead.

Catalogue of Monsters

Hit Points - Like characters, monsters have Hit Points that determine how much damage they may sustain before they die. This category
displays the monster’s Hit Point range.
Armor Rating - illustrates the creature’s natural Defensive Values when attacked from the front, side, or behind.

Attack Value - displays the creature’s regular Attack Value. While humanoid Attack Values which may change from weapon to weapon, the
Attack Value of animals and undead usually remain constant.
No. of Attacks - shows the number of attacks per minute available to the monster.
Weapon Type - virtually every creature has some sort of attack mode to cause damage, either physically or mentally. This category informs
the Referee of what type of attack modes the monster uses in combat (e.g. weapon, bite, or claw).
Damage - determined by the monster’s weapon type and potentially enhanced by the creature’s Strength. This category illustrates which
damage dice are rolled for any given attack. When dealing with multiple attacks or various attack modes, the damage dice are displayed for each
type of attack. It is important for the Referee to remember that the monster inflicts 1 point of actual damage for each damage die rolled. For
example, a wolf bites a character and inflicts 244 points of damage. Despite the result, 2 points must be deducted from the victim’s Hit Points,

while the rest may be absorbed by its armor (if applicable).

Saving Throws - this category displays the creature’s innate Saving Throw
vs. harmful attacks. The Saving Throw is the same for any of the following:
Death, Disease, Fear, Magic, Mind, and Poison. The number shown reflects

the lowest number on a d20 that the creature needs for a successful roll. For
example, a creature with an 8+ Saving Throw needs to roll an 8 or better on its
d20 to successfully make its save. If the number rolled is 7 or below, the creature
failed and is subject to the full effects of the attack.

Speed - this value represents the creature's physical movement rate, whether
running, swimming and/or flying. Some monsters have two separate speed
values. This displays the movement rate for each movement type available. For
example, a Harpy has a 2 / 6 speed that represents a movement rate of 2 (running)
and 6 (flying).

Avecki are odd-looking creatures that resemble frogs or toads of unusual size. These
creatures stand almost two feet tall at the shoulder and squat down on four legs in
a crouched position. They have several layers of thick skin that cover their body,

giving them the equivalent to a3 AR. The heads of these creatures are much narrower
than a normal frog and have three separate eyes that allow them to see 360 degrees.

They move about by hopping and may leap a distance of 20’.

Avecki are carnivorous creatures. They possess the ability to spit a digestive fluid on

potential prey that are within melee combat. This attack requires it to strike a DV
0 on its d20 roll. If successful, the victim suffers 2d4 points of actual damage, as

this form of acid is harmful only to living tissue. The fluid also affects the visual

organs of the victim and forces him to make a Saving Throw vs. Poison or else
become blind. The poison is very weak and grants the character a +4 Saving Throw.
If failed, the affliction lasts 1d4 days. In some cases (25%) the blindness is permanent

and can only be healed through the use of spells or magical items.

Once potential prey is killed, Avecki absorb the victim’s blood and plasma. Avecki inhabit lakes, swamps and other

watery areas. Possessing a

Speed of only 2 on land, their webbed feet enable them to move about quickly in water. This gives them a Speed of 5 when submerged. Avecki
tend to gather in small groups and are generally encountered in numbers ranging from one to three.

These horrific creatures are greatly feared by all humanoid
races. They resemble huge snakes with a large heads, huge
fangs, and 8' long, coiled bodies. Their scales are often

green to light brown and the coloration is blotchy. Half-

way down their scaly hide protrude large bat-like wings
that allow them movement through the air at a Speed of
7, as opposed to their Speed of 3 when slithering on the
ground. Its thick scales grant the Basilisk an AR of 10.
Basilisks attack with their venomous bite. Their razor sharp
teeth allow them to easily penetrate armor. When the d6
is rolled to determine damage, only 1 point is deducted
from the victim’s armor. The remainder of the damage is
subtracted directly from the victim’s Hit Points, Its venom

is so deadly that each successful bite requires a Saving
Throw vs. Poison (at -2) or the opponent dies instantly.
Even if the Saving Throw is successful, the victim still
suffers 2d8 points of actual damage.

Once engaged with a potential prey, Basilisks seldom flee.

They inhabit desolate countrysides and wastelands. Since

no one has ever witnessed a Basilisk reproduce (and live

to tell the tale), sages are unsure of its mating cycle.

Monsters

163

Bear, Grizzly

Grizzly Bears reach a height of more than 12 feet when standing on their hind legs.
When encountered, there is an 80% chance that these animals will simply pass by
and leave travelers alone. Once injured, however, these creatures become aggressive
and attack until slain,

Grizzly Bears possess an Attack Value of 7 and attack with two clawed paws each
combat minute. Both of these weapons must be focused on the same combatant.
Each successful hit inflicts 244+3 points of damage. In addition to their high AV,
these animals have a natural Armor Rating of 7 due to their thick hides.
Bears can move surprisingly fast for such large animals. Although they move with
a Speed of 5, they are unable to maintain such a movement rate for more than 10
minutes. After such a sprint, Grizzlies become tired and must stop running. The

hides of these animals are worth a great deal of money in humanoid communities,

the average pelt selling for 80 gold coins.

Bloodril

These arthropods resemble crabs with no pincers. Their six legs end in small hooks
that help them attach themselves to almost any surface. The outer shell of these
animals are extremely hard and gives them a natural Armor Rating. They also grow
a fungus over their exterior which is used as camouflage.
Bloodtils are normally found hanging from ceilings. Since their camouflage makes
them appear to be patches of moss or similar vegetation, they gain surprise 70% of
the time. When a warm-blooded victim passes beneath them, the arthropods drop
on their prey and attack. A d20 must be rolled to determine if the Bloodril
successfully hits. When attacking, these creatures have an Attack Value of 2 and are
only required to strike the victim's DV2. If successful, the monster grabs hold of
the victim with its hook-like appendages and attacks with a sucker mouth located
underneath its shell. The bite inflicts 1 point of damage and continues to drain 1
additional Hit Point of damage each minute that it remains attached. Although
they typically drop on prey, Bloodrils can jump for short distances and may easily
attack creatures from the ground.
The only way to remove a Bloodril is to kill it. If weapons are employed against the creature while it is attached, the host victim suffers
1/4 of
the damage from the attack. Although physical attacks are possible, the most effective way of killing the creature is with
fire. The body
chemistry of this monster is very susceptible to this form of attack. Applying a torch or other open flame inflicts 1d4 points of damage
to the
creature each minute. The victim does not suffer any damage from this attack.

Victims slain by Bloodrils are slowly digested over a period of several days. Since these creatures cannot digest metal, wood,
or cloth items and
weapons will be left intact. They are known to inhabit underground caverns, tunnels, and dungeons.

Boar, Giant

These animals reach a height of 3' at the shoulder and weigh in excess of 150
pounds. Two large tusks protrude from their jaws. Giant Boars use these weapons
to inflict damage in melee combat, Boars are aggressive hunters and attack 75% of
the time. Due to their thick hides, they possess a natural Armor Rating of 4.

When entering combat from a distance of at least 20', a Giant Boar can charge and
trample opponents. This method of attack allows it to inflict 4d4 points of damage.
Although most of this damage may be absorbed by armor, 4 points must be deducted
directly from the Hit Points of the victim. When engaged in melee combat, the
Giant Boar flails about with its tusks. A successful hit inflicts 244 points of damage.
Worse still, this animal automatically gores any victim that falls unconscious. This
attack is similar to the Final Blow skill and instantly kills the victim.
The Giant Boar is a fearless aggressor. It is generally found in forests, but has also
been encountered in hills and plains.

164

Monsters

Bren

Bren stand almost 3 feet high and weigh less than 60 pounds. Although these

monsters resemble monkeys, they are covered from head to tail with scales. These

scales grant these animals a natural Armor Rating of 2. They are proficient climbers
and have a 100% chance of success. Bren are carnivorous by nature and hunt in
packs of 3 to 6.

Claw/ Claw/ Bite

When attacking, Bren use their two small, clawed hands and pointy fangs. The
former attacks inflict 1d4 points of damage per claw, while the latter inflicts 1d2.

Cowardly by nature, they will retreat if engaged with a superior enemy, often
climbing trees or other surfaces to escape.

These creatures have their own language and communicate through a form of
chattering and grunting. Bren make their lairs in tangled woodlands and dense
forests, often building small structures high up in the trees.

These large, flightless birds are commonly found in stagnant marshes. They stand

and small frogs but have been known to attack humanoids when threatened or

provoked.

When attacking in melee combat, the Brysha uses its beak to inflict 1d4 points of

damage. Its large legs and long strides give it a Speed of 4. Brysha travel in groups
ranging from seven to 12. Once agitated, these creatures will follow fleeing prey,

hissing and spitting.

Brysha generally nest on muddy shores, When its eggs are endangered, the creature
inflicts +2 damage due to its fierce, aggressive response. Brysha eggs can be sold on
the open market for 25 gold coins apiece as this animal can be trained to serve as a
guardian. A typical nest will hold 1d4 eggs.

Cavasha

Cavasha are creatures of gruesome appearance. The lower portion of their body is

globes, which possess no pupils. Alchough blind, their hearing and sense of smell is

exceptional and grants the Cavasha the equivalent to Undead Vision with 30' range.
In addition, they possess iron-like claws that they use to attack. The skin color of a

2

Cavasha is light brown to gray. Their upper torso is thin and leathery, granting
them a natural 4 Armor Rating.

Claw/ Claw

When engaged in melee combat, these creatures use their claws. Each successful hit

2d4 / 2d4
8+

inflicts 244 points of damage. Although these weapons are formidable, Cavasha

possess an even more deadly attack. When engaged with a melee opponent, the

creature’s eyes produce a flash of light, This flash occurs every combat minute and

each time the victim is exposed, he must make a Saving Throw vs. Death or else
become permanently blind. A blinded character instantly suffers all Attack Value
and defensive penalties associated to the affliction. There is no means of protecting
against this attack mode except by averting one’s gaze or by using the Gaze Evasion

skill. The flash only affects the Prime Opponent of the Cavasha.

These monsters are carnivorous and extremely aggressive. They are most often

encountered in groups of one to four. These creatures live in dark caverns, swamps

and subterranean lairs.

In combat, Centaurs can employ a variety of weapons,
both melee and missile. In addition, they can employ a
shield when using one-handed weapons. This increases
their DV1 by 1 or 2 points depending on the type of
shield used. Although capable of employing shields, these
creatures may not wear armor.

Ifa Centaur encounters an enemy at a distance of no less
than 50’, it can charge the adversary and attempt to
trample it. This charge requires a 1d20 roll, with the

Centaur’s Attack Value being an 8. The creature must
only strike its victim’s DV2. This attack, if successful,
inflicts 4d4 points of damage. In addition, during that
particular combat minute the opponent receives a -2 AV
penalty when attempting to strike the Centaur.

Female Centaurs are also exceptionally strong. They tend

|

to be flirtatious, especially around Human males, and
attempt to make male Centaurs jealous with their

behavior. Although more intelligent, they usually leave
decision making to the males in order to soothe the male’s
dominant ego.

Male Centaurs are violent and aggressive creatures. They
enjoy drinking and become rowdy and pugnacious toward other humanoid races. Since they are resistant to the intoxicating effect of alcohol,
they do not receive penalties to attack rolls while under the influence. Centaurs are more likely to start fights to display their combat prowess
while drinking, especially if there are female Centaurs around.
The societal structure of a Centaur community is based on the herd. There is no single leader within any group, causing decisions to be made

by general consensus. A normal herd consists of a few dozen Centaurs, the majority being women. Female Centaurs are adept warriors and will
help to defend the herd if it is attacked. Young Centaurs do not fight. Even so, the young are as arrogant and aggressive as the older males.
Centaurs speak their own language and can communicate with Merikii. In addition, 25% of them speak the Juravian language as well.

Constrictor Vine

hese monsters appear as nothing more than an ordinary clinging vine, similar to
ivy. When a warm-blooded creature wanders within 10', however, their true identity

becomes apparent. Constrictor Vines attack by flailing at potential prey with their

long, thin vines. If the attack is successful, the creature has succeeded in grabbing

hold of its target. Although the initial hit does not inflict damage, the monster does

inflict 1d2 points of actual damage each minute thereafter, constricting the snared

opponent.
Vines

It is possible for exceptionally strong characters to break free from the hold of this

special

or lower than 10%. This number is increased by 1% for each full point of Strength

monster. To attempt this, the Player must roll 1d100 and score a number equal to

If failed, the character remains held and may not attempt to break free again.

In addition to sustaining damage, the victim receives a -1 Attack Value penalty
each minute he is held. This penalty is cumulative up to a maximumof -5. Spell

casting, which requires components (Beast, Necromancy, Elemental and Enchanter) is prohibited due to the lack of

mobility.

Although deadly to small animals, Constrictor Vines possess a very low Armor Rating and few Hit Points. This makes
adventurers.

Creepers are a form of sentient liquid that survives by devouring living tissue.

These creatures are constantly searching for prey. Although they do not possess
eyes, they can sense blood at a range of80'. Because they have a ravenous appetite,
they always attack. Like amoebae, they possess no actual form and propel themselves
by using pseudopodia. Their liquid form enables them to seep under doors and
through small cracks. Since they are almost transparent, they surprise victims 80%

of the time.
Acid Touch

When entering combat, Creepers attack by touching their victims. Each time they
successfully hic their victim’s DV2, they secrete digestive juices. These juices are
acidic and inflict 143 points of actual damage. The digestive fluids are acidic enough
to damage flesh but do not harm metal, wood, or stone.

Creepers are found in subterranean areas. Although they are generally encountered
as solitary creatures, small groups of two to four are sometimes spotted.

ability to judge distances and suffer a -3 AV when using missile weapons.

Cyclops attack in melee combat with their large, clawed fists. Their massive strength
enables them to inflict 1d10 points of damage, which is increased by +5. They are
aggressive combatants and will not retreat, even in the face of unbeatable odds.
Although they are proficient warriors with their natural 9 Attack Value and colossal
Strength, these creatures lack intelligence and are not very cunning.

When encountered, there is a 25% chance that the creature will be wearing a crude

form of armor made from animal furs. These furs increase the monster’s Armor

Rating by 2 and absorb up to 20 points of damage before being destroyed. Like
normal armor, these furs offer less protection as they are damaged.

Speaking only their racial tongue, these brutes are unable communicate with others races. Cyclops aggressively attack anything they encounter.
They typically live in mountainous regions within large caverns or secluded valleys. Occasionally, they gather in small groups to attack humanoid
settlements for food and plunder. Groups ranging between four and eight have been encountered.

Cy-Eb

5

Cy-Ebs are a race of woodland humanoids created by Marda. Although they look
like normal Humans from the waist up, the lower torso of the creature is goat-like
with two cloven hooves and brownish fur. They are known to inhabit dense forests
and are territorial by nature. Cy-Ebs shun all contact with humanoids. They speak
their own language and can communicate with animals of all kinds.

Shriek

When forced into combat, Cy-Ebs emit a shrieking sound that causes 144 points
of actual damage to all humanoids in a 10' radius. This sound does not injure

animals or undead, nor does it affect characters that suffer from the detriment of
Deafness. Other than their voice, these creatures possess no other form of attack.

Cy-Ebs are capable of altering their appearance into that of different animals such

as Wolves and Giant Boars. While in these forms, they have the attack forms of the

animal and, in addition, gain the Armor Ratings of the animal type as well.

Not only does a Cy-Eb have the ability to transform itself at will, the creature can

dominate animals much like Beast Mages. This domination is permanent and can
dominate up to ten animals at any given time. Unlike the Pagan Magic, this magical friendship does not drain
the Cy-Eb, nor does it cause the
creature any detriment. The types of animals that can be affected are Bren, Dogs, Hawks, Rats, Snakes, and Wolves.

Although these creatures are not aggressive by nature, they are very protective of their territory and the animals within its boundaries.

the Cy-eb will seek the death of the offender. Due to their magical nature, sages and wizards have been studying these creatures
intensely. Their
solitary tendencies make such observations almost impossible. Some Beast Mages believe that the blood of these creatures
increase a spell
caster’s ability to dominate animals. This, however, is unproven.

Death Hag

70 + 2d6

Death Hags are humanoid creatures that are distant relatives of Hags. They stand

between 5' to 6' tall and have thick, leathery skin that grants them a natural Armor

Rating. Their hair is usually white or gray in color. Although their mouth is filled

with sharp, pointed fangs, the creature’s most feared attack is its gaze. When engaged
in melee combat, the eyes of the creature begin to glow with a deep reddish color.
For some unexplainable reason, any character gazing into their eyes is required to

make a Saving Throw vs. Death or immediately die. This attack is only effective

Bite

against the monster’s Prime Opponent.

In melee combat, the Death Hag uses its fangs to attack. The bite of the creature

inflicts 1d6 points of damage and the victim is automatically exposed to its eyes
unless the victim chooses to avert its gaze or use the Gaze Evasion skill. If neither is

successful, the victim is required to make a Saving Throw.

Death Hags are carnivorous and attack anything they encounter. Using their

humanoid appearance to dupe unsuspecting prey, these monsters will attempt to
lure victims close enough to attack. Once slain, its eyes become harmless.

Doppelganger

30 +1d6

These creatures exist as mere shadows that wander about searching for hosts. They
are evil, possessing a mischievous and spiteful attitude. They are naturally invisible
and thus are undetectable without the ability to see invisible objects. Those claiming
to have seen them report that they float inches above the ground and make no
sound. In addition, they say that Doppelgangers possess misty images with glowing
eyes. Due to this, most characters are unaware of their presence until it is too late.

Suffocation

A Doppelganger is capable of attacking its victim’s mind. When an attack is made,

the Referee should roll 1d20. The score must be equal to or higher chan the victim's
Intellect score (rounded down). If the character has the racial benefit of Mind

Protection, he gains a +2 modifier. If the roll fails, the creature is heavily drained
and may not attempt to attack again for one full day. If successful, however, the

Doppelganger attaches itself to the host and melds into the character's body. From

this point on, the creature may not be attacked or damaged. Each day thereafter,
Monsters

the monster drains the character’s Stamina by .1d3 points. This reduces the victim’s Hit Points. It is possible to remove this parasite through the
casting of a Cure Disease spell. If the spell is successful, the monster detaches from the host and enters a period of dormancy for 3d4 days.

When a host’s Stamina reaches 0, the victim dies and the Doppelganger cocoons itself within the dead body and begins its transformation. This

metamorphosis requires a 24-hour period. If allowed to reach fruition, the Doppelganger becomes a Limris. The only way to stop the
metamorphosis once it begins is to destroy the host’s body with fire or acid. The creature will attack anyone who attempts to destroy its cocoon.

If the host dies before its Stamina is reduced to 0, the monster removes itself from the body and begins to search for a new victim. When a
Doppelganger is destroyed, its form dissipates and nothing remains.

When fighting in defense of its cocoon, a Doppelganger attacks by engulfing its enemies. This attack suffocates the victim and causes 1d4
points of actual damage. The creature can attempt to do this once per combat minute and has the equivalent to a7 AV. The monster only needs
to strike the target's DV2 unless the character can see invisible objects. In that case, the monster must successfully hit the character's DV1.
Due to their invisibility, these monsters are extremely difficult to fight. Although they possess an AR of 5, anyone attempting to damage them
suffers a -10 AV. This penalty is lessened if the character is proficient in the Blind Fighting skill. Creatures able to see invisible objects do not
suffer the penalty at all.

of magic, Dragons use their massive jaws and spear-like fangs to inflict damage to
their enemies. These weapons inflict 10d6 points of damage with each successful attack. In addition, these brutes are capable of breathing fire,
This blast affects a 30’ diameter area and may be employed once every 5 minutes. Any creature within area of effect suffers 5d10 points of actual
damage.

Dragons enter periods of dormancy and often remain in hibernation for periods of more than four decades. If their slumber is disturbed they
will retaliate. This vengeance will not be extinguished simply by destroying those that awoke it, but will expand to the regions surrounding their
lairs. Since anger and hatred drives these creatures, they are almost impossible to appease.
These great winged terrors exist in legends and stories that date back to the times of the gods. Marda created them in her anger as a weapon to

destroy those that invaded her lands. Due to their Strength and almost invincible nature, the slaying of a Dragon is a feat of which only the
greatest wizards can boast. Only a handful of these creatures exist and those that do dwell far from inhabited lands.

Dungwala

These creatures appear as nothing more then a thin mist, lurking within dense
forests or jungles. Dungwala, or Mist Spirits as they have come to be called, have
no solid form. They cannot be destroyed through non-magical means. They feed
on all living things and attack by surrounding and suffocating their prey. They
have a natural AV of 6. Each time the Dungwala hits, the victim is required to

make a Saving Throw vs. Death or else stand petrified with fear. This affect lasts for
2d6 minutes during which time the victim is defenseless. Each minute thereafter,

the creature will suffocate its prey, causing 1d4 points of actual damage.

Dungwala are supernatural creatures that are immune to non-magical weapons.

When attacked with magical weapons or spells, the monster only sustains 1/2

damage. They are capable of attacking only one creature at a time and, once its
prey is killed, both the monster and the victim will vanish. After digesting meals,
these horrible creatures enter a period of dormancy that lasts between 3d6 days.
When killed, the misty form of the creature turns to a fine black ash.
Monsters

Dast Demon

These elemental creatures are large cyclones of wind that inhabit dry, sandy regions
of the world. They attack by engulfing their victims and slowly eroding their armor,
clothing, and skin. Each combat minute that a victim is trapped within the cyclone,
it suffers actual damage equal to 1d6. In addition, the victim is blinded by the
swirling sand and suffers all the penalties associated with Blind Fighting.

Dust Demons are required to physically strike their opponents to engulf them.
They have an Attack Value of 5 but must only strike their target’s DV2. Once a
victim is trapped inside, it has two options. The first is to attack the Dust Demon
while suffering the negative modifiers of being blinded. The other option is to try
and break through the cyclone and escape. The chance of success is equal to 2%
per full point of Strength. Each combat minute it is attempted, the Player must roll
1d100. A score equal to or lower than the character's chance is a success. Despite
success or failure, the victim suffers an additional 1d2 points of actual damage due
to the speeds of the sand within the cyclone.
Dust Demons are chaotic by nature. Each combat minute that the creature is engaged, there is a 5% chance that it simply disappears. This will
release any victim trapped within the cyclone. Within 2d4 minutes after vanishing, the monster will reform within 60' of its last location.
During its absence, the Dust Demon will have completely regenerated all lost Hit Points.

Dust Demons feed on living creatures, metals and other solids. They will attack until destroyed. Since they are capable of devouring all types
of materials, nothing of value will remain.

Davadin

Duvadins, which are often referred to as Mind Snares, are microscopic creatures
that attempt to infest the bloodstream of humanoid creatures. Related to the Power
Tick, these monsters attack the mental functions of its host and feed on the creature’s

intelligence. Each day that a Duvadin lives in a host’s bloodstream, it devours .1d4

points of Intellect. The victim does not receive a Saving Throw. There is no known
protection from the attack. When the host is reduced to a 0 Intellect, it dies. In
addition to draining the victim of intelligence, there is a 50% chance that a victim
will forget any skill (e.g. Weapon, Magic, Open Locks) he or she uses for a period of

1d4 hours. Although this does not permanently remove the skill from the character,
it does negate its ability (Attack Value, spell ability, etc.) for that time. The 1d100

roll must be made each time a skill is used.

These creatures thrive in stagnant waters. When contacted, they have a 25% chance

that they penetrate the skin of the host. If successful, the host immediately suffers

the monster’s effects. If the attack is unsuccessful, the host will feel a numbness that

quickly passes. There are two ways to kill a Duvadin once it attaches to the host.
The first is through the casting of a Cure Disease spell on the victim. The second method is through the ingesting of ordinary garlic cloves. Once
eaten, there is a 60% chance that the Duvadin will be destroyed. This chance is reduced by 10% for each additional clove.

Dweller

These large, beetle-like insects live in dark, subterranean places such as caverns or
catacombs. They possess a thick shell that covers their bodies and have six legs that
help them move quickly along floors, walls, and ceilings. Having a blackish
coloration, they are well camouflaged in darkness, allowing them to surprise prey
50% of the time. In combat, these large beetles attack with their mandibles, which
are capable of locking onto prey. Once a dweller successfully hits, the creature
begins crushing its victim with its powerful pinchers, inflicting 1d3 points of actual
damage each minute. It is impossible to remove the mandibles. The only way to
escape is to kill the creature.
Dwellers are dangerous as they travel in packs ranging between three to seven.

They are aggressive and attack until destroyed, pursuing prey relentlessly. The shell
of the creature is incredibly hard and grants the insect a natural Armor Rating of 4.

Monsters

Ebryn

These animals appear to be nothing more than a type of ordinary bat. They are
blackish in color and possess a wingspan of roughly 2-3’. During flight, they emit
a shriek, which allows them to “see” with a form of radar endemic to their species.
However, Ebryns are not normal bats.
Tn combat, up to four of these creatures can attack a single opponent. They attack

by swooping down on their victim and biting with their fangs. A successful bite

inflicts 1 point of damage and injects the prey with a poison. This venom causes
the victim to make a Saving Throw vs. Poison or else lose 1 point of Speed. This
loss is not permanent and lost points return at a rate of 1 per hour. A victim must
make a Saving ‘Throw each time he is bitten. If a character’s Speed score is ever

reduced to 0, he falls unconscious and is helpless. At this time, the attacking Ebryn

will attach themselves to their prey and drain it of blood. This process inflicts 1 Hit
Point of damage per minute for each Ebryn that is attached.

These animals live in tangled forests and rocky caverns. They are nocturnal hunters,
feeding only on warm-blooded creatures. Flocks of Ebryn range between 5 and 20.

Fire Bat

Like normal bats, these mammals have developed a sense of radar which enables
them to navigate through caverns and narrow hallways at high speeds. Their bodies

have a reddish orange color, while their wings are black. Even though their eyesight
is poor, Fire Bats are very sensitive to light. When a light source comes within 50’,

these creatures began emitting sonic vibrations. These vibrations, although physically
harmless, cause mental exhaustion in humanoids. This prohibits spell casting. The

vibrations extend to a range of 100' and will continue until the light source is
extinguished or the bats are killed.

Tn addition to their ability to negate spell use, the blood of this mammal ignites in
a fiery blast when exposed to air. Any creature standing within 5' (melee range) of

15+

a Fire Bat suffers 1d2 points of actual damage.

Fire Bats dwell in caverns and venture forth at night to hunt. They tend to feed on
small rodents and have not been known to attack humanoids. It is an interesting
fact that Fire Bats are immune to all fire based attacks whether magical or otherwise.
Sages perform extensive research to find the source of this immunity.

Monsters

171

Fireborne

These humanoids appear as normal Humans except their skin is crimson to orange
in color, All Firebornes have flaming red hair and thick beards and mustaches.
Their eyes are a copper color and grant them Night Vision with a 50' range.
Due to some natural or magical phenomena, these humanoids radiate heat of
immense magnitude. This enables them to touch opponents and inflict 1d4 points
of actual damage. They are required to physically touch their opponents, but must
only strike the victim’s DV2. They do not wear armor nor do they carry shields.
When sufficient damage is inflicted to reduce these humanoids to 0 Hit Points,

they are completely consumed in flames and reduced to ashes. This incineration
inflicts 1d4 points of actual damage to characters standing within 5’ (melee range)
of the Fireborne.

Males are generally stockier and taller than their female counterparts and are very
atrogant and conceited. Since they deem battle as a method of proving physical
strength, they often engage in melee combat. They speak their own language and very few attempt communication with other humanoids.
Fireborne are immune to all types of fire, magical or otherwise. They enjoy places of extreme heat such as volcanoes or deserts. Groups between
15 to 30 have been encountered in small communities. Once they settle in an area they quickly attempt to dominate everything around them.

Although immune to fire, these humanoids are incredibly sensitive to cold and suffer +3 points of damage per damage die inflicted.

Flame Spivit

These creatures are pure fire and possess no actual body, appearing simply as pillars

of flame. They are immune to non-magical attacks. Those creatures that stand

within 5' (melee range) of the Flame Spirit suffer 2d4 points of actual damage due
to the extreme heat. Although immune to non-magical weapons, these creatures

are susceptible to magical spells and items. In addition, they suffer +2 points per
die of damage when faced with spells that simulate cold.

Flame Spirits are the creations of Kitharu. They are aggressive by nature and feed
on the charred remains of the creatures they destroy. These abominations are capable
of delivering a blast of heat to a single creature standing within 20'. This blast
inflicts 2d6 points of actual damage and may be employed once per combat minute.
Not much is known of these monsters. They dwell in extremely hot areas such as
volcanoes and lava pools, emerging only to attack and devour potential prey. The
heat inside the actual body of these creatures is so intense that it can melt metal,
gold, and almost all other materials. Once a victim is slain, the spirit will consume
its prey and nothing will remain.

Frost Heave

These 3’ tall humanoid creatures live on the highest peaks of vast mountain ranges.
It is within these snow-covered areas that they make their communities. Frost Heaves

vaguely resemble Sprites, though their skin is an icy white color. They possess
sharp teeth, claws, and are carnivorous.

Frost Heaves live within their secluded mountain lairs during the warmer months
of the year. Only during the winter months do they migrate down to the lower
terrain. This venture is only long enough to gather food. Frost Heaves hunt by
digging secret lairs underneath great snow banks. In these hidden areas, they sit
and wait for unsuspecting prey. Due to their color, Frost Heaves are 90%

undetectable when hiding, unless detected through magical spells or the Observation
skill.

These creatures attack with their icy claws. Since they are innately cold, their mere
touch inflicts 1d2 points of actual damage. Their attack requires a d20 roll, though
they are only requited to hit their victim’s DV2.

Monsters

Frost Heaves are a tribal race that live under the dominance of regional chiefs. The tribal chief is exceptionally frigid to the touch and inflicts

1d6 points of damage. He possesses a 5 AV and has 26-31 Hit Points (25+1d6). The leader’s most feared attack, however, is the ability to
summona “blizzard” once per day. This blizzard centers on him, affects a 30' diameter area, and lasts 1 combat minute. All within this sphere
suffer 2d10 points of actual damage.

These creatures are naturally immune to the cold and all cold-based attacks, including spells. They are susceptible to fire, however, and sustain
+3 damage per die of fire damage rolled.

Gargoyle

Gargoyles are monsters that stand roughly 4' tall and possess bat-like wings that

sprout from their shoulders. Their skin coloration is light green and their eyes are
a pale white. Although they can shamble about on their misshapen legs, they are

capable of great speeds while flying. They possess Night Vision with a 90’ range
and can see invisible objects within 20’.

These horrid creatures delight in the killing of all living creatures. They are capable
of inflicting severe wounds with their sharp claws and have a natural AV of 7.
Although they have average Hit Points, these creatures regenerate wounds at a rate
of 1 Hit Point per minute. They suffer only 1/2 damage from non-magical weapons.
Gargoyles are territorial by nature and are known to attack civilized areas. A typical
flock of Gargoyles can range between three to seven in number. After devouring
prey, or when reduced to fewer than 10 Hit Points, these monsters turn themselves
into stone for protection. While in this state they are impervious to all attacks
(whether magical or otherwise) and regenerate normally. This transformation lasts for 3d6 days. The only way to destroy a Gargoyle is to inflict
enough damage to reduce the creature to 0 Hit Points before it turns to stone.

Since Gargoyles are territorial, some cultures carve the images of these creatures from stone and place them within the boundaries of their
communities. They hope to dupe other Gargoyles into believing that the territory is already claimed, prompting them to leave the area.
Monsters

173

Geleb

Gelebs are a race of reptilian humanoids. They stand over 6' in height, their bodies

are covered with greenish scales that lend to their natural AR. Although they possess

a Speed of 3 on land, these marine creatures can move about swiftly in the water

and have a Speed of 6 when swimming. Like frogs, they breathe air but possess

large lungs that allow them to remain submerged for almost two hours at a time.

In combat these creatures attack with their clawed hands. These claws inflict 1d4+3
points of damage with each successful hit. These creatures may attack twice per
combat minute. Gelebs do not receive penalties for fighting while submerged and
often pull potential victims into the water to drown them.
Gelebs hate all humanoids and do not associate with any other race. They often
band together in large groups and attack villages located on lakes and oceans to
plunder goods and gather slaves. Due to their carnivorous nature, Humans and
other humanoids taken in raids will eventually be slain and eaten.

The Geleb race is tribal in nature. Each tribe is controlled by a leader. This leader is stronger than the others, possessing an 8 AV. In addition,
he will possess 32-42 Hit Points (30 +2d6) and has an exceptional Intellect.

Gelebs are superstitious and fear magic. Due to this, there are no spell casters within a tribal structure. When faced with obvious magical effects
(e.g. Bone Shards and Pyrotechnics), there is a 50% chance that a Geleb will flee. Those that do not flee will immediately attack the spell caster.

Gemril

Gemrils live in salt water. They resemble rock formations that usually rest on the

ocean floor or coral reefs. Their coloration makes them 90% undetectable and
their thick rocky shell grants them a natural Armor Rating of 3.

These creatures feed on living things. When a warm-blooded creature passes within
10', a Gemril lashes out with four long, spiny tentacles. If a tentacle attack is
successful, the appendage attaches itself and will not release until severed. Due to
the tentacle’s restrictive nature, the victim receives a -1 AV for each one attached.

Although the tentacles inflict only minor damage per hit, the Gemril secretes a
poison through its spiny brambles. This poison causes the victim to make a Saving
Throw vs. Poison each minute or else suffer damage. The victim’s Saving Throw is
modified by -1 for every tentacle that is attached. If the save is failed, the character
sustains 1 point of actual damage per tentacle. In order to break free from the
monster's grasp, the character must sever the tentacles. Each appendage has 8 Hit
Points and an AR of 1. Severed appendages are regrown at a rate of one per day.

Gemrils are insidious creatures that mainly feed on small fish and other aquatic animals. When the opportunity arises, they are known to attack

humanoids, mermaids, and other creatures. Once a victim is slain, the creature retracts its tentacles into its great maw and completely devours

its prey. This process takes only a few minutes and, once completed, nothing remains.

Giant

Giants are colossal humanoids that stand over 15" tall. They appear very much like
large Humans, but possess large foreheads and leathery skin. Their skin, which is
generally covered with thick, course hair, grants them a natural Armor Rating of 4.
Even though they appear to be of low intelligence, Giants are very cunning. They
possess Night Vision with a range of 60".
When engaged in melee combat, Giants typically use large clubs. These weapons,

which they wield in two hands, inflict 3d6+6 damage due to their Strength. The
club can sustain three notches before shattering. When unarmed, a giant can use
its fist in melee combat. Each successful hit inflicts 1d10+6 points of damage.

In addition to their thick hides, these colossal humanoids often wear furs which
absorb 30 points of damage and increase the creature’s Armor Rating by 3. Like
normal armor, the protection offered by the furs is lessened as they sustain damage.
174

Monsters

Giants lack the intelligence necessary to construct better weapons or armor. They are very egotistical and rarely disengage from combat unless
faced with impossible odds. They have been known to cooperate with Ogres, Cyclops, and Ghantu to pillage towns and villages.
These brutes tend to live in mountainous regions. Although they are aggressive, it is rumored that they can be persuaded to talk when bribed
with large portions of wine. In fact, some humanoids can barter for services or safe passage with promises of treasure or alcohol. However, if
such promises go unanswered, a Giant’s lust for vengeance will be insatiable.

Griffon

Griffons are the creations of Marda, goddess of beasts. The lower portion of the
monster is a large lion that stands roughly 4' at the shoulder. Sprouting from its
back is a pair of large wings that reach a wingspan of around 12’. Although they
appear feline, these creatures possess not one but two large eagle heads. They are

fast runners, and have an 8 Speed while flying.

When attacking in melee combat, these creatures use their razor-sharp beaks. Each
one inflicts 5d4 points of damage ona single combatant. Aggressive hunters, Griffons

will attack humanoids and animals when hungry.

These beasts are known to inhabit rocky ledges and cliffs. Their nests typically
contain 1d2 eggs, which have a market value of 300 gold coins per egg. Being
protective of their offspring, Griffons attack anyone that comes near their lairs.
Young griffons have an AV of 3 and inflict 1d4 points of damage with their sharp
beaks. If captured while they are young, Griffons can be trained to serve as steeds.

Gura-Shen

Gura-Shens are creatures that exist in the world as mere shadows. Their transparent
bodies are humanoid in appearance. They possess Undead Vision that extends to a
range of 90'. They inhabit desolate areas such as graveyards or fallen shrines.
Although they appear undead, they do not suffer damage when exposed to sunlight.
They move about through the air only inches from the ground and although
transparent, are unable to move through solid objects.
When entering melee combat, these creatures attack with their claws. Each attack
inflicts 1d10 damage. Their unearthly form grants them a natural Armor Rating of
10 and makes them immune to non-magical weapons. In addition, Gura-Shens
are immune to magical spells, fears, and poisons.

These monsters can optionally emit a psychic blast on a single living creature,
inflicting 2d6 points of actual damage. There is no Saving Throw against the attack.
Gura-Shens are diabolical creatures that hate all living things. They do not speak
and never attempt to communicate with any creature that encounters them. They attack instantly and fight until destroyed. These phantasms
are territorial and may not leave the area in which they exist. The exact dimensions of their area seem to vary, but is typically no more than a
500' radius. Due to this fact, an area infested with a Gura-Shen should be avoided unless sufficient items are at hand to destroy it.

Hag
Hags resemble elderly females, either Human or Elven, with white or silvery hair
and gnarled, leathery faces. Their bodies are typically frail, weighing less than 100

pounds and standing roughly 5’ tall. Their small stature and weak appearance allow
them to dupe humanoids into their lair. Only female Hags have been encountered,
though males are believed to possess the same characteristics.
These monsters have two methods of attack. The first is their claws. These iron-

like talons inflict 1d8 points of damage with each successful hit. Although this

allows them to inflict terrible wounds, their second form of attack is the more
deadly. The stare of a Hag causes a victim, standing within 20’, to make a Saving
Throw vs. Death or become frozen with fear for 3d10 minutes. This gaze weapon
may be used once per combat minute on a single humanoid. If Saving Throw is
failed, the victim is defenseless, and the Hag can attack the victim’s DV2.

Monsters

175

It is possible to avoid the Hag’s gaze attack. At the beginning of the combat minute, prior to the initiative roll, the character may opt to avert

his gaze or use of the Gaze Evasion skill. If either is successful, che character is immune to the monster’s gaze for that particular combat minute.

Hags live in small caves or huts on the borders of dismal swamps or desolate countrysides. They are intelligent and cunning creatures that use
their elderly, helpless appearance to lure creatures into their gaze range. Although they do not typically carry treasure with them, they have been

known to hoard items or trinkets acquired from previous victims in their lairs.

Harpy

\

Harpies are a twisted mixture of a Human and an avian.

The torso of the creature resembles a Human with sharp

teeth and matted hair. Instead of Human legs, the creature

has feathery appendages ending in sharp talons. Large

wings sprout from their backs, allowing them to fly about

with a Speed rating of 7.

They are usually encountered as a mated pair, though

sometimes more than ten have been seen in the same flock.
They dwell in dismal swamps and forests, preferring to

make their nests high up in trees or rocky bluffs. Aggressive

hunters, they are fond of Human flesh and attack Humans
in preference to any other creature.

Harpies usually attack with a large bone club or similar
weapon. Occasionally, they have been encountered
wielding melee or missile weapons acquired from previous
victims. When unarmed, they use their razor-like talons.

In addition to their natural weaponry, Harpies often carry

shields to use in defense. This increases their natural Armor
Rating of 5. Due to their wings, these creatures are unable
to wear armor.

The most feared attack of a Harpy is its song. This song,
which sounds like wails, moans and shrieks, causes
physical pain to all within 30’, inflicting 1 point of actual
damage per minute. Although a Harpy may sing
continuously, it is incapable of attacking during the same
combat minute. There is no Saving Throw vs. the attack
and only deaf creatures are immune to its effects. The
damage inflicted by the Harpy song is not cumulative,
and only 1 point of damage is suffered regardless of how
many Harpies are singing.

The nest of a Harpy is usually littered with bones and

equipment from previous victims.

Hydra

These gigantic monsters are the twisted creation of Marda, the goddess of beasts.

Although their bodies resemble six-legged reptiles, the Hydra has many separate

necks ending in great heads with massive jaws. Specimens have been encountered
with fewer than 10 heads, while others have been reported with more than 12. Due

to their keen eyesight, Hydras can see invisible objects or creatures within 30’ and

possess Night Vision that extends to a distance of 120’.

In combat, the Hydra attacks by biting its prey. Up to three heads may attack any
single opponent. Each attack has a 12 AV and inflicts 2d10 points of damage.
Due to the thick scales that cover the beast from heads to tail, the Hydra possesses

a natural AR of 15. The main body of the monster has its own Hit Points (100 +
4d6). Unless sufficient damage is inflicted to its trunk, the creature will not die. In
addition to the main body, each head has its own Hit Points (30 + 2d6). When a
head sustains sufficient damage, it dies, though the creature may continue to attack.

Hydras regenerate 3 Hit Points per minute. The main body of the creature is healed first through this process. Once at full potential, the healing
will begin to revive slain heads one at a time. Each head must reach its maximum Hit Point potential before the regenerative process begins to
heal another. If the body is slain, the heads cease to function and the regeneration stops.
Hydras devour prey and then enter a dormant state for long periods of time. Depending on how much the beast consumes, these creatures have
been known to sleep for periods of more than 20 years. Another similarity between these monsters and Dragons are the creatures’ greed. Hydras

are known to collect massive amounts of treasure, which they horde in their subterranean lairs. Even while in their dormant state, one or more
of its heads will remain awake in order to watch its treasure trove and admire its wealth. This makes it almost impossible to surprise a Hydra.

When its treasure is in jeopardy, these gigantic monsters will fight to the death.

Javyn

Javyns are large birds that inhabit mountainous regions. They possess a wingspan

of roughly 20' and tend to have grayish to black feathers. Their fast speeds (both
on the ground and in the air) grant them a natural AR of 3. They are aggressive
hunters and attack by means of their long, needle-like beaks. Using their strong

necks, they can pierce through armor and inflict larger amounts of actual damage.
Only 1 point of damage is deducted from a victim’s Armor Points while the
remainder is subtracted from its Hit Points. Although willing to feed on almost
any form of carrion, Javyns will attack living creatures without hesitation.

Territorial by nature, these creatures fight to defend their feeding grounds from
other predators. They tend to live on craggy bluffs with a typical lair containing
two to four of these beasts. Although they do not collect treasure, it is possible to
find items left from previous victims within the brambles and thickets of their lair.

Ji-Amyd

According to legend, these gigantic eagles were given to Shalmar by the goddess
Marda as a gift from one sister to another. They are majestic and noble birds with
soft coloration and a wingspan reaching more than 12'. Their beaks are razor sharp
and they possess exceptionally keen eyesight. Blessed by the goddess of life's magic,
these birds possess a very special power.
Although Ji-Amyds can attack with their razor sharp beaks and inflict 2d4 points
of damage, these creatures emanate an aura of life that causes 1d10 damage to all

undead within 100'. Living creatures are unaffected by the aura and simply feel

warm and safe within its presence.

Since these creatures are blessed with the natural ability to destroy undead, villages

and towns are considered blessed when a Ji-Amyd chooses to nest near their

community. They hate undead and attack them whenever possible. These great
birds are territorial by nacure and resist all forms of captivity. When imprisoned,
the bird’s aura will cease and the noble avian will die within 1d10 days.

Jaldanni

Juldanni are beasts that resemble small dinosaurs. They stand upright on their
hind legs and reach a height of nearly 10’. Their thick scales grant them a natural

Armor Rating of 6. They are aggressive hunters having an innate Attack Value of 7.
Although the front claws of the animal offer no combative abilities, the huge jaws
of the monster inflict 2d8 points of damage with each successful hit.
These creatures are known to inhabit rough terrain such as hills and broken plains.

They are carnivorous and attack prey without hesitation. They travel in packs that
range between five to nine and are nocturnal hunters. Their keen sense of smell
grants them the Tracking skill with a 60% chance of success.

Tribes of Higmoni often domesticate these monsters and use them as steeds. When
ridden, a Juldanni can attack normally but their Speed is reduced to 4. Like horses,
riders must be skilled in the Horsemanship skill and receive the Attack Value penalties
associated with Mounted Combat.

Keshara

These snake-like creatures average 8' in length. Kesharu have a humanoid torso

and large reptilian head. Instead of arms, they possess six tentacles that each reach

a length of 6'. These appendages are used to hold prey until such time as the
monster can devour its victim. Their bodies are covered with gray or green scales
that grant the creature a natural Armor Rating of 7.
In combat, these creatures attack with their tentacles. All six attacks must be centered
on a single opponent. Each tentacle inflicts 1d2 points of damage and attaches to
the victim. Due to the restraining nature of the appendages, the Kesharu is then

able to bite the victim’s DV2. In addition, the victim receives a -1 AV for every

tentacle that holds him. The tentacles of the beast remain attached until severed or
until the Kesharu is slain. Each appendage has 15 Hit Points and an Armor Rating
of 3. Once sufficient damage is inflicted, it is severed and requires 1d4 days to
regenerate. Even if all of the appendages are severed, the creature is still able to bite

potential prey but must successfully strike the victim’s DV1.

In addition to the monster's powerful bite that inflicts 3d4 points of damage, a Kesharu can breathe a blast of fire on a single target in melee

combat once every 6 combat minutes. This fire inflicts 246 points of actual damage. There is no Saving Throw versus the affects of the blast,

and the creature is not required to roll to hit.

These creatures are typically found in deserted ruins or subterranean caverns. Kesharu are carnivorous, and their favorite diet is Human flesh.

They are aggressive hunters and will not retreat from combat unless engaged with a superior adversary.

Keva

Keva are a type of herbivore that can be found on wide-open plains or rolling hills.
‘They stand almost 4’ at the shoulder and are covered with multiple layers of leathery
skin. Although this offers the animal a natural Armor Rating, it can be harvested
like wool from a sheep. This leathery skin can be used to fashion repair kits for
both leather and padded armor simply by cutting the material into strips and then
tanning the hide. A single Keva can supply enough leather for 25 repair kits.

Keva attack with their large horns. Although they possess a low Attack Value, a
successful hit inflicts 1d6 points of damage. They are typically found in groups
ranging from 10 to 25. Half of the number will be male and the other half female
and young. Male Keva will attack in groups if the herd is threatened.

At one time Keva were common but as humanoids discovered the value of their
hides, they were hunted to near extinction. Some cultures have learned to
domesticate the animals. In such cases, Keva regenerate their leathery folds every
six months.

Monsters

Limris

Limrises are the corporeal forms of transformed Doppelgangers. A Limris is a
humanoid monster that possesses yellowish skin, long claws, and reddish eyes.
Their faces are thin and haggard and their teeth are pointed. Although they have
revolting appearances, these creatures possess the ability to mutate themselves and
can change their looks at will. They can alter their forms to vary in height from 3°
to 8' and give themselves any racial appearance they desire. This ability makes the
creature very dangerous.
These monsters are capable of rending opponents with their sharp, iron-like claws.

Equivalent to a 7 Attack Value, these creatures attack twice per combat minute.
Each successful hit inflicts 2d4 points of damage. The skin of a Limris is naturally
hard, which gives the creature an Armor Rating of 6. However, they are immune to
non-magical weapons and suffer no damage from such attacks. Being magical by
nature, the Limris is protected with the Mind Protection benefit and is immune to
such attacks as ESP and Telepathy.

In addition to their claws, these monsters possess an even more deadly attack, A Limris can attempt to dominate the mind of a humanoid
creature that is within 30'. This attack requires a full minute of concentration and can only affect creatures with a lower Intellect than that of

the Limris. To determine who can be affected, consider the Limris to have an Intellect score of 12.1-13.0 (12 +.1d10).

When attempting to dominate a character, the Limris and the victim must each roll 1d20. The Limris adds +1 for every full point of Intellect
a 9.4
it possesses greater than its victim (rounded down). For example, a Limris with a 12.5 Intellect attempts to dominate a Human with

modified downward by -1 for each full point of Intellect he has lower than the
Saving Throw. A successful save indicates the character blocked the mental attack and avoided being dominated. Failure means the victim's
mind is under the control of the Limris.

Dominated creatures perform any actions the monster commands without question, regardless of personal safety. There is no limit to the
number of creatures a single Limris can control. Strong warriors are often kept to serve as its defenders, while weaker humanoids are devoured

to appease its ravenous appetite.

Limrises are very intelligent and cunning creatures. They are capable of conversing with any humanoid creature and strive to gain power and

control over all races. Due to their arrogance, a Limris will seek to kill and devour any humanoid that thwarts its attempt at domination.

When a Limris is killed, all the creatures under its domination will instantly regain their minds and control of their actions, but they will not

remember anything that occurred while under domination. Note that characters protected with the Mind Protection benefit gain a +4 Saving

Throw against the domination attacks of the Limris.

Lizard, Rhino

Rhino Lizards are a species of gargantuan lizard that dwells in mountainous or hilly
regions. They make their lairs in underground caverns and venture forth at night
to hunt for prey. Being nocturnal hunters, these beasts have gained superior Night
Vision with a maximum range of 90'. Their bodies average a length of 10’ and
most specimens weigh in excess of 500 pounds. Sprouting from the foreheads of
these animals are two horns that reach an average length of 3’.
Even though these creatures are immense, they can run extremely fast and impale
potential combatants with their horns. By doing so, the Rhino Lizard can inflict
terrible wounds equal to 6d4 point of damage. Only 6 points of damage ate deducted
from the defendant's armor while the remainder is subtracted directly from the
victim’s Hit Points. In order for a lizard to employ this attack, it must be at least 30'
away from the intended target and successfully hit the victim's DV2. Whether or
not a charging lizard strikes its opponent, the following combat minute the beast
may engage in melee combat, attempting to bite prey with its powerful jaws. A
successful hit with this bite inflicts 2d6 points of damage.
Rhino Lizards are solitary creatures. They typically feed on deer, mountain goats, and wild boar, but they have been known to attack humanoids
on occasion. When encountered, there is a 75% chance that the Lizard will simply ignore wanderers. If provoked, the creature will attack.
Monsters

Lizard, Steam

Steam Lizards are amphibious creatures that live in streams, rivers, and small lakes.
Their skin is covered with scales that range from light to dark green. Their bodies

are typically 5-6' in length. Although they feed on rats, frogs, birds, etc., they will
eagerly attack humanoids that pass near. These beasts are amphibious; they do not
typically leave their watery habitat.

These animals attack with sharp teeth that inflict 1d8 points of damage. They
possess a natural Attack Value of 4 and their scales grant them a 5 AR. The body of
a Steam Lizard tends to be very hot, and they are therefore less susceptible to fire.
When attacked with fire, normal or magical, Steam Lizards subtract 1 point per
damage die inflicted. In addition, they can exhale a blast of steaming water on
creatures standing within 10' once every 3 minutes. When employing this attack
form, Steam Lizards are only required to hit their target’s DV2. This scalding water
inflicts 2d6 points of actual damage.

Magoul

Magouls are twisted, undead creations of Necromancers. Although they have a
vaguely Human appearance, their hairless skin is blotchy and leprous. Most are
hunch-backed, possessing elongated arms, crippled legs, and yellowish eyes.

When engaged in combat, these undead attack with their clawed hands and vicious
bite. Each claw inflicts 1d2 points of damage, while the bite causes 1d4. Due to the
severity of their deformed stature, they cannot wear armor.
Magouls detest all life and seek to destroy it. Because they suffer 1 point of damage
for each minute they are exposed to sunlight, these abominations reside in catacombs
or underground crypts. They can see is darkness possessing Undead Vision with a
70 range.

Monsters

Manticore

These creatures possess the body of a great lion. Its fur is usually golden or dark
yellow, while its mane is jet black. The head of the beast is that of a distorted
Human possessing yellowish eyes and pointed fangs. The tail of the creature ends
in several large spikes, Sprouting from the shoulders of this monster is a pair of
leathery wings that allow flight. These beasts make their lairs in high mountains or
desolate moors. Manticores are ravenous carnivores, constantly hunting for prey.
Once a victim is slain, the Manticore will grasp the corpse in its claws and fly off to
its den to devour its meal. In this manner, treasure may accumulate in its lair.
A Manticore attacks melee opponents with its massive bite, inflicting 5d4 points of
damage. When attacked from the side or behind, the beast can employ its spiked
tail. This form of attack possesses a 6 AV and inflicts 3d6 points of damage. The
tail attack may not be used against the creature’s Prime Opponent.

These beasts possess a minimal intelligence and speak their own language. If

constantly fed, a Manticore may aid humanoids on raids or even serve as a steed. If food is not available, the monster will

devour its master.

Medusa

These creatures were once Human but were altered by Dembria into a race possessing
angelic beauty. The goddess's arrogance and pride allowed her to bestow on this
race of mortals the gift of immortality. This act angered Enigwa and, on his return,
he cursed the race and twisted them into creatures of hideous visage. Stripped of
their beauty and driven insane by the torment of Enigwa’s magic, these creatures
fled into hidden underground lairs and desolate swamps.
Altered by Enigwa, the lower torso of these humanoids was transformed into that
of a serpent’s body. Reaching a length of more than 7’, the hide is covered with
thick scales that vary in color and size, The upper torso of these monsters remain
Human, though their faces are twisted and grotesque and their hair is a mass of
living snakes that move freely about the Medusa’s head. Although these small serpents
will hiss and bite, they cannot inflict damage.
The Medusa’s main method of attack is to bite opponents in melee combat and
inflict 246 points of damage with their razor sharp fangs. However, these creatures

Mermaid

A Mermaid possesses the body ofa beautiful Human female from the waist up but,
instead of legs, the creature has a large tail that helps it move through water with a
Speed of 6. It uses its beauty to lure sailors and other seafarers into melee range so
it may attack with its sharp claws. These weapons inflict 1d4 points of damage for
each successful hit. While in the water, a victim suffers all penalties associated with
Water Combat.
Mermaids are carnivorous by nature. They have been seen by sailors during the
sinking of ships and are known to drag victims far below the surface to their deaths.
They travel in numbers ranging from five co ten. Although most encounters with
these creatures have occurred in the ocean, some have been spotted on coral reefs
or sunning themselves on deserted beaches. While on land, the Speed of a mermaid
is dramatically reduced from a 6 to a 2 rating.

Monsters

181

These creatures speak their own language and do not attempt to communicate with other humanoids. Being mammals, they are incapable
of
breathing water and must surface periodically. Their large lungs allow them to remain submerged for up to 60 minutes. Mermaids tend
to live
in underwater caves that contain breathable air, Although the stories surrounding mermaids are filled with death, some sailors have
reported
being saved by mermaids while on the high seas, or of awakening within the cavernous lair of a mermaid only to be set free after their
wounds
have healed. Since these instances are very rare and are contrary to conventional belief, they are dismissed as simple hallucinations,

Mevoshk

Mevoshks are a breed of snake that is greatly feared. Reaching a length of 12’, these
creatures have a blackish color with yellowish designs on their large hoods. Like
cobras, these snakes are aggressive and attack with a quick, poisonous bite. They
have a natural Attack Value of 9 and their scaly hides and quick movement rates
contribute to their 4 AR. Mevoshks are usually encountered as mated pairs. Males
and females have the same general characteristics and attack in the same fashion.
In combat, the creature attacks by biting its prey. If the creature successfully bites
its target, the victim sustains 1d4 points of damage and is required to make a
Saving Throw vs. Poison at -3. If the Saving Throw is successful, the victim suffers
no ill effects. If the attempt is failed, the character is affected with a poison that
freezes all the muscles throughout his body. This causes the victim to become
completely rigid, resembling a statue. While paralyzed, the victim is helpless and
all attacks are made on its DV2. To make matters worse, the victim will suffocate to
death in 10 minutes unless cured through the use of spells or magical items. The
only non-magical cure for this venom is the administering of Brye Leaves to the wound, which has a 75% chance of curing the affliction.

Mind Demon

Mind Demons inhabit the magical energies that mages use to manipulate spells.
They are attracted to spell casting, much like Power Ticks, but instead of infesting
the caster and draining his Spell Points, they attack the wizard’s mind. Each time

the spell caster invokes a spell, the creature can bombard the wizard with a mental

attack. This attack drains -.1d3 from the character’s Intellect score unless the
character successfully makes a Saving Throw vs. Magic at +2. This draining is
permanent and cannot be regained. When a character is reduced to 0 Intellect, he
is dead. Furthermore, the loss of Intellect affects the character’s maximum number
of skill slots and spell attempts. Mind demons attach to wizards and wait for them
to use their spells so they can attack. Since an Enchanter constantly channels magic
to maintain his spells, he is susceptible to an attack once per minute until his spells
are negated. Characters that have the benefit of Mind Protection or are protected
by Mind Masking or Mind Cocoon are immune to the effects of the monster.
Mind Demons are supernatural creatures and do not possess a physical body or
form. They are immune to magic and cannot be injured by magical or non-magical weapons. The only way to damage these creatures
is to resist
its mental attack. For each successful Saving Throw the caster makes, the Mind Demon sustains damage equal to 1d6. When
the creature
sustains sufficient damage, it is destroyed. Unfortunately for wizards, they regenerate Hit Points at a rate of 3 points per day.

Minotaur

Originally part of Marda’s golden herd of buffalo, these creatures were twisted by
Grom into humanoids with powerful builds, nasty tempers, and almost no
intelligence. They stand 9" tall and possess an exceptional Strength that allows

them to inflict +4 damage with their clawed fists. Their muscular builds are covered

with thick, matted fur and the heads of these brutes resemble large bulls with great
horns, Minotaurs possess poor eyesight and have Night Vision with only a 30'
range. They speak their own language of grunts and guttural snarls.
Minotaurs possess a 10 AV. Due to Grom’s transformation, they lust for battle and
are immune to all fear-based attacks, magical or otherwise. They are vicious
combatants and attack without thought or provocation.

182

Monsters

Mold, Gray

Gray Mold is a carnivorous fungus that thrives underground. This monster grows
to a diameter greater than 30’ and has coloration that resembles dungeon stone.
This camouflage makes it unnoticeable from a distance of more than 20'. In the
center of the “carpet” protrudes a 1’ tall growth resembling a mushroom or stalk.
This growth possesses the intelligence and actual Hit Points of the mold. In effect,
a character cannot damage the monster unless they attack this growth.

The main attack of the mold is to release spores from the moss carpeting. When
inhaled, these spores cause severe respiration discomfort and automatically inflict
2d6 points of actual damage. The mold is capable of releasing spores every minute,
though each burst may only be directed at one creature.
Any creature killed by the spores is slowly engulfed by the moss and digested. This

process takes 1d4 hours. Since it is unable to consume items such as metal, wood,

or cloth, the mold will simply conceal the articles. This results in small mounds
within the carpet of moss.
Once the growth is slain, the moss reverts to normal vegetation and is harmless.

Moss, Power

Power Moss grows in dark, subterranean places. Its coloration varies; it can grow
on ceilings, walls and floors. Possessing intelligence, this monster seeks to devour

living creatures and, through the digesting of blood and plasma, grow in size. A
typical patch of this moss covers an area equal to 20', However, specimens have
been discovered covering more than 100".

Created by Galignen, god of disease, these monsters have the ability to manipulate
magic. The exact size of the growth determines the amount of Hit Points and Spell
Points the creature possesses. For every 10° of growth, the creature has 3d10 Hit
Points and 2d8 SPTS.
A Power Moss has two forms of attack. First, it is capable of releasing spores into
the air, inflicting 1d10 points of actual damage to all living creatures within 10’. Its

more deadly attack, however, is the ability to cast spells once every combat minute,
providing it has the appropriate Spell Points. The following descriptions display
the effects of its magic:

Skin Irritation (7 SPTS) - causes the victim’s skin to become irritated, itchy, and develop a painful rash. For a period of time equal to 3d6
minutes, the victim suffers a -3 Attack Value unless it makes a successful Saving Throw vs. Disease.
Mind Spores (14 SPTS) - creates a cloud of spores that affects a single target creature within 40’ and causes it to make a Saving Throw vs.

Disease. If successful, the spell has no effect. If failed, the spores enter the victim's blood system and control its mind for a period of time equal
to 2d6 minutes. During this time, the creature stands paralyzed and is unable to perform any actions.

Affliction (21 SPTS) - causes the victim’s lungs to fill up with liquid, much like pneumonia, for a period of time equal to 3d6 minutes. Each
minute the character is affected, it sustains 1d2 point of actual damage. The effects of the magic can be negated by a successful Saving Throw
vs. Disease or through the casting of a Cure Disease spell.
Power Moss does not sustain any damage from magical spells. In fact, the moss absorbs magical energies and transforms them into its own Spell
Points. Each time a spell is cast at it, the creature absorbs 1/2 of the cotal Spell Points used against it each combat minute (rounded down). This
is done automatically, and the creature can still attack while absorbing this energy. For example, an Elementalist casting a 3rd level Pyrotechnics

spell (27 SPT'S) would not inflict any damage on the moss. Instead, the creature would absorb 13 Spell Points.

The only way to damage the growth is by using weapons that cause normal damage. Any part of the growth can be attacked as the Hit Points
of the creature are spread across the total surface area of the monster.
When a Power Moss is destroyed, it slowly dissolves, releasing a cloud of poison gas that lasts 1d2 hours. Any living creature standing within 20'
or entering the cloud is required to make a Saving Throw vs. Poison or else suffer 4d6 points of actual damage. Because the creature only
devours living tissue, it is possible to find items of previous victims under the moss growth.

Although the moss may not physically attack, it emits a cloud of poisonous spores
when killed. Creatures within 20' must make a Saving Throw vs. Poison or die

within 4d6 hours. Since the poison is very weak, the Saving Throw is at +3.

Once the moss is killed, investigation will reveal 1d4 roots growing underneath its surface. ‘The Referee should roll 1d100 for each root.
If the
score is equal to or lower than 75%, the root is poisonous. The poison is so potent that anyone eating the root must make a Saving
Throw vs.

Poison with a -2 modifier or die instantly. If the save is successful the victim still suffers 244 points of damage to its Hit Points. Roots that are

not poisonous have a chance of being a skill root. Again the Referee should roll 14100 for each appropriate root. A score of equal to
or lower
than 50% equals a success. These roots grant an automatic skill (Percentage or Leveled) to the person who eats it, and contains
a random

amount of knowledge equal to 1d100%. Any score higher than 50% indicates it is an ordinary root.

If a skill root is digested, the character instantly gains the skill and percentage points that accompany the proficiency within the root. This
knowledge is permanent and does not require a skill slot. If she already knows the skill, the percentage points are simply added to her existing
base. These roots may not contain skills requiring more than 2 skill slots. It is impossible to tell the difference between a poisonous root, an
ordinary root, or a skill root without the Plant ID skill. Even with the skill, the character cannot determine the knowledge within a skill root.

Mal-Hound

30 + 2d6

These monstrous canines stand almost 4’ at the shoulder. Instead of fur, they possess
black scales that cover their bodies, granting them a natural Armor Rating of 5.
They hate all life and attack without hesitation. These beasts possess Night Vision
with a range equivalent to 100’ and can detect invisible creatures up to a maximum
distance of 50'. Due to their superior olfactory sense, Mul-Hounds are faultless

a Saving Throw vs. Fear or suffer a -5 Attack Value. This penalty lasts for 3d10+5

their heads. These antennae grant the creature a sight equivalent to Undead Vision

When engaged in melee combat, these abominations attack with their two sets of
large pincher-like claws. These weapons each inflict damage equal to 2d6, which is

increased by +5 due to their Strength. In addition to the pinchers, the creature can
attack with its mandibles. This attack delivers 344 points of damage. The beast will
administer all three forms of attack to a single opponent and will not change
opponents until its prey is slain.

Monsters

Their bi-pedal bodies are covered with thick plated shells that grant them a natural Armor Rating of 9. In addition, these monsters may only
be struck with magical weapons. Any non-magical weapon automatically notches against the shell plating of the creature.
Mulkrogs possess very little intelligence and are not at all cunning. They immediately enter combat with any foe despite its strength or number.
They have no compassion and want to destroy all life. It is believed that these creatures were twisted and tormented by Grom and Necros,

driving them to insanity. They are fearless combatants and are immune to all fear-based attacks, natural or magical. Once engaged, Mulkrogs
attack until destroyed. Due to their desire for combat and thirst for blood they can fight to -15 Hit Points before dying. Also, once the creature
falls into negative Hit Points, its Attack Value is increased to 15 due to its death rage. Mulkrogs do not require sustenance and are unaffected
by poisons or gaze attacks.

the creatures possess many layers of folded flab. Their
eyes are nothing more than empty sockets and their
mouths resemble sucker-like appendages. To hide their

hideous appearance and lure humanoids into their
clutches, Nagdu have the ability to mutate themselves,
altering their appearance to that of any humanoid race.

In addition, they speak all languages.

These vile monsters are known to lurk near swamps,

dense forests, or desolate countrysides. Occasionally they

will wander into populated areas to hunt for prey such

as Humans and Merikii, which are their favorite forms
of sustenance. They attempt to lure potential victims
into isolated areas before returning to their natural form

and devouring the victim. Nagdu attack by attaching

their sucker-like mouths to the flesh of warm-blooded
creature and draining them of lifeforce. Once the
monster successfully hits, there is no way to escape since
the monster latches on with the dozens of small hooklike teeth that are located within their mouths. Each
minute thereafter, the creature drains 1d6 Hit Points
from the victim.

Nagdu are creatures of deception. They use their

mutation ability to catch characters off guard and then
attack, There is no way to stop the Hit Point drain short
of killing the Nagdu. Their thick skin grants them a
natural Armor Rating of 5.

Necromer

Necromers resemble huge, black spiders that reach a height of more than 4'. Their

eight legs are covered with thick fur. These arachnids possess large mandibles. They

lurk within places of darkness such as murky swamps or cavernous mountains,
seeking to devour the life of both man and beast. Its venomous bite causes 1d10
damage and secretes a poison that instantly kills the victim unless a Saving Throw
vs. Poison is successful. Although deadly, this venom grants the victim a +2 save.

Although these creatures do not spin webs to trap prey, they do have the ability to

cocoon victims once they are dead. Once this is accomplished, the Necromer begins
devouring the remnants of the creature’s life force. This process requires 1 full
hour. When completed, the victim becomes a Zombie and serves the Necromer’s
mental commands. To make matters worse, there is no limit to the number of

Zombies that the creature can control. Due to this horrid ability to animate creatures,

it is said that Necros created the Necromers. To add to this belief, these monsters

suffer 3 Hit Points of damage for each minute they are exposed to direct sunlight.

Necromers are intelligent and cunning. They use their Zombies to attack and kill creatures so they can feed. They are cowardly by nature and
avoid open confrontation with large groups. Their powers are strong enough to animate creatures as large as Ogres. The larger Zombies inflict
+2 damage in combat and possess an additional 2d6 Hit Points, Furthermore, their Attack Value is equal to 7.
Sages and other scholars are mystified by the powers of animation that these creatures possess. Although attempts have been made to capture
and study these monsters, all have failed.

Nemris

Nemrises are small crustacean-like creatures that inhabit damp, dark subterranean
areas. Their hardened shell grants them a natural Armor Rating and is a grayish
brown color, The creature’s six legs help it move very quickly. Nemrises feed on all
living creatures and automatically attack anything that comes within 60°.
In melee combat a Nemris attacks by spitting digestive fluid at a victim in melee
range. This fluid is so acidic that it causes 1d6 damage. In order for the fluid to
successfully strike the intended target, the Nemris must roll a d20. However, the
creature need only hit the victim's DV2. The blood of the creature is also highly
acidic. Any weapon that strikes the creature automatically notches. Only magical
weapons are immune to the effects of the fluids.
Once the intended victim is killed, a Nemris stops secreting the digestive fluids
and begins to devour its prey. Since they are often found in groups of five to ten,
they are extremely dangerous to adventuring parties.

Ogre

Ogres appear to be extremely large Humans. They stand 9" tall and possess facial
and body hair. They tend to be unkempt and smelly. Since Ogres are nocturnal,
they have Night Vision with a range of 60.

These brutes wield boar spears in melee combat with an Attack Value of 7. These
weapons inflict 2d6 points of damage, adding +4 damage due to their Strength.
Although they are rarely encountered with shields, most Ogres wear animal skins

for protection. These skins have 30 Armor Points and are considered to have an
Armor Rating of 3. Like normal armor, as these furs absorb damage their Armor
Rating is reduced. These furs enhance the Ogre’s natural Defensive Value of 2,

which is attributed to their thick skin. Ogres enter combat with great ferocity and
only retreat when faced with overwhelming odds.

Ogres live solitary lives. They are fairly intelligent and 50% can speak another
language. Created by Grom, they possess aggressive tendencies, seeking to attack
instead of negotiating. They are most often found in mountainous regions, though some wander into hills or plains seeking food or plunder. In
addition, it is common to find Ogres working with Cyclops, Giants, and Ghantu.

Monsters

Phase Shifter

Phase Shifters are creatures that dwell in temporal rifts. They do not exist completely
on Juravia, entering the world only to hunt for food. These creatures resemble a

ctoss between avians and reptiles. Their reptilian mouths are filled with sharp fangs,
which the creatures use to attack. The body resembles a large hawk. Its body, along
with its 1' tail, is covered with mottled feathers ranging from yellow to brown.
In combat, a Phase Shifter continuously shifts from location to location. This shifting

grants it a natural AR of 9. In addition to this significant defense, a Shifter always

strikes the opponent’s DV2. When in combat, the creature attacks twice per minute.
Regardless of the initiative dice rolled, the creature always strikes once at the
beginning of the combat sequence and then receives one more attack at the end of
the sequence. Its alien nature allows the creature to regenerate 2 Hit Points per
minute, though this may never place it above its maximum Hit Point potential.
Each successful bite inflicts 1d8 points of damage to its victim. If the creature rolls
a natural 20 as an attack, it does not inflict additional damage as normal creatures,

but instead draws its victim into its temporal rift lair. During this time no aid can be given to the victim and the Phase Shifter will attempt to
devour its prey. If successful, nothing will remain of the victim and there is no chance of resurrection or healing. If the intended victim destroys
the Phase Shifter, the temporal rift will close. This forces the intended victim, the creature’s body, and its creasure from the rift.

In addition to the biting attacks, a Phase Shifter can spit forth a blast of grayish ooze. This may be done once every 3 combat minutes. It is
required to hit its intended target with this attack method, but must strike only the victim’s DV2. If the target is hit with the ooze, it begins to
dissolve the victim's armor or skin. This inflicts 3d10 points of damage to any type of armor. Flesh, being more resistant to the ooze, only suffers
2d8 points of actual damage. Due to the properties of the ooze, armor damaged by this method of attack may not be repaired.
If the creature is slain on Juravia, it simply vanishes and returns to its temporal rift lair to enter a period of hibernation, which lasts between one
to two months. After that time, it begins hunting again.

The blood of a Phase Shifter has magical properties. If consumed within 10 minutes of the Phase Shifter’s death, the draught increases the
drinker’s Stamina statistic by +.1d10 points. This increase is permanent. Note that only 1d3 draughts of ichor may be obtained from a single
Phase Shifter. In addition to the blood, the creature’s fangs may be crushed into 1d2 applications of a powdery salve. This salve can be applied
to any wound and heals the target creature 3d6 Hit Points, cures any disease, neutralizes any poison, stops natural or magical bleeding, and
actually causes the target creature to become younger by 1d3 years. It is only possible to gain benefits from the remains of the creature if it is
killed within its temporal lair. Because this is rarely accomplished, the fangs of the creature are highly prized. Sages, Enchanters, and members
of royalty are known to pay up to 1,500 gold for a single application of the salve.

Phoenix

The Phoenix is an avian creature that is near extinction. The feathers of these large

birds have reddish to orange coloration and their eyes possess a silver or golden

hue. They are known to inhabit hot areas such as volcanoes or lava pools and are
immune to all fire-based attacks. The blood of the animal is magical and there is a

5% chance per draught that the drinker will gain the creature’s immunity to fire.
This benefit is permanent. Because of this, thousands of these majestic birds were
slaughtered for their blood. Each animal possesses enough blood for 2d4 draughts.

These creatures attack by using their razor sharp beaks, which inflict 3d4 points of
damage. In addition, their bodies radiate intense heat that causes actual damage to

any creature within 10'. This damage, inflicted each combat minute, is equal to
1d6 points and must be deducted directly from the victim's Hit Points.

The Phoenix is a territorial creature and only mated pairs inhabit a particular area.

They are very intelligent attacking only in self-defense. There is a 20% chance,
when encountered in their nest, that there will be 1d2 eggs. The eggs must be kept
at temperatures greater than 200 degrees or else the unborn Phoenix will die. A Phoenix egg typically hatches in 2d4 months and the baby avian
instantly takes flight and leaves the nest. If taken when they are young, these animals can be trained as guardians.
Although few creatures have attempted to communicate with these great birds, Phoenixes are capable of speech. Their vocabulary is very
limited and the Kithsaran dialect they use is ancient and almost incomprehensible. Once trained, these monsters make fearless adversaries and
will defend their masters without thought of personal safety.

Power Tick

Power Ticks are microscopic organisms that survive by draining magical energy
from a humanoid host. They can be encountered in any terrain or environment
and are greatly despised by wizards. Although little is known about these creatures,
it is believed that they dwell mainly in the magical energies that spell casters harness
to power their spells. When a spell is cast, the Power Tick follows the magical
energies into the caster and automatically cocoons itself within the wizard.
Although the creature cannot affect the character’s Intellect, skills, Hit Points, or
defensive abilities, it does drain 1d8 Spell Points each time a spell is invoked. Since
Enchanters are constantly drawing power from the magical energies to maintain

their spells, they are the most commonly affected wizard. Each night the Enchanter
sleeps, he loses 1d10 Spell Points due to the creature's insatiable appetite. This is
potentially devastating. Mages regain drained Spell Points through normal sleeping.

There are only two ways to remove a Power Tick. The first method is to avoid the
manipulation of magic for a period of 30 days. Although this method does not kill the creature, it does deprive it of nourishment, forcing it to
find a new host. However, if the wizard begins casting spells around its general location, he may be infected again. The second method is to be
the recipient of a Cure Disease spell from a Berethenu Knight. If successful, the Power Tick is destroyed.

Pyroghin

Pyroghins are turtle-like animals with thick outer shells. The creature moves about
slowly as it plods along on its short, stunted legs. Although they appear harmless,
these monsters are carnivorous by nature and will attack living things when hungry.
The creature’s thick shell grants a natural 7 AR, making it difficult to hit.
When engaged in melee combat, these beasts radiate intense heat that inflicts 1d4
points of actual damage on all creatures that enter melee combat with the beast.
The creature can also attack with its beak-like maw that inflicts 3d4 points of
damage for each successful hit. This monster has a natural Attack Value of 5.

Pyroghin tend to inhabit hot, arid regions. Mated pairs are usually encountered,

though groups of up to four have been reported. They are known to burrow into

the sandy banks of an oasis and wait for potential prey. These creature are immune
to all fire-based attacks, Cold-based attacks inflict +2 damage per die rolled.

188

Monsters

Rat, Giant

Giant Rats dwell mostly in subterranean caves or swamps. Their coloration is usually
black or brown. They are aggressive and, due to their ravenous appetites, seek to
devour everything they encounter. Though they are not greatly feared for their
combat ability, they are usually encountered in packs numbering a few dozen.
When entering combat, Giant Rats swarm their enemies in large numbers. Since
they are small, it is possible for five of them to attack a single adversary. They attack
by biting their prey, inflicting 1d2 points of damage.
These vermin are quick runners and even faster swimmers. This entitles them to a
Speed of 6 when swimming. They can fight effectively in water, so they do not

suffer any penalties toward their AV when submerged. Like many animals, Giant
Rats fear fire. This fear causes them to be held at bay if presented with even a small
fire source such as a torch.

Rast Bugs

These insects live in swarms and choose to make their lairs in the remains of rotted
wood or broken stone. When disturbed, they attack all creatures within 30' of the
lair. Although they inflict very slight damage to living tissue, their body chemistry
causes metal objects to rust and become useless. This is dangerous for adventurers
that rely on their weapons and armor for survival.
When attacking, Rust Bugs swarm their victims and automatically inflict 1 point
of actual damage per minute. In addition, all metal armor (ring mail, chain mail,

plate mail, shields, etc.) will suffer 1d4 points of damage. Metal weapons (swords,
axes, etc.) will suffer the equivalent of one notch each minute they are used to
attack the swarm.
The Hit Points shown to the left reflect those of the entire swarm. Although attacking
with normal weapons only causes one-half damage, these insects are afraid of fire

and will ignore any character that is carrying an open flame. When enough damage
is inflicted, the swarm will disperse and leave the area.

Sea Serpent

Sea Serpents are gigantic creatures that live in the deepest of oceans. They resemble
snakes with their long, coiled bodies and thick scales. Reaching a length of more
than 200’, these monsters are known to coil themselves around ships. Their size
enables them to inflict structural damage to vessels at a rate of 1 point per minute.

This will destroy a small ship in 10 minutes and a large warship in 30 minutes.

While coiled around a vessel, the serpent may be engaged by more than 20
opponents, all of which must strike its 15 Armor Rating to inflict damage.

In addition to sinking ships with its great mass, Sea Serpents are capable of biting

sailors with their huge, fanged mouths. Each successful hit inflicts 6d8 points of

damage. Only 6 points of this damage is deducted from the armor of the victim

while the remainder is subtracted from the victim’s Hit Points. This is due to the
monster’s sharp, armor piercing fangs.

Sea Serpents are greatly feared by sailors of all races. They are aggressive and only
retreat when reduced to less than one-quarter their total Hit Points. Although they
attack ships whenever the opportunity arises. They are known to live near coral

mere mention instills fear in the hearts of even the bravest of souls.

Monsters

Shonril

These small birds are a light gray or soft blue color and have silver eyes. Their
feathers are soft to the touch. Shonrils are the creations of Shalmar, goddess of life,
and they are incapable of attacking or causing damage.
Shonrils are creatures of compassion and do not associate with creatures that perform

cruel or unjust acts. They possess the powers of healing, and their soft cooing heals

1 Hit Point per minute to all creatures within 30'. The song of a Shonril is capable

of healing any type of damage the victim has sustained.

These birds are extremely rare and only a few dozen are believed to exist. If held in
captivity, they cease to sing and die within 1d10 days.

Shrieking Stones

These creatures appear to be nothing more than an ordinary quartz or crystalline
rock formation. In fact, the unique qualities of this monster are not made apparent
until a light source is brought within 20'. When subjected to illumination, these
rocks begin to emit an ear-piercing shriek that causes physical damage to all within
20'. Each minute a creature is exposed to the sounds, it suffers 1 Hit Point of actual
damage. Only creatures that are deaf are immune to the effects. The noise will
instantly stop if the light source is extinguished.
Shrieking Stones are not overtly dangerous. Their sustenance consists of the minerals

found within the rocks near their habitat. Although they possess a good Armor
Rating duc to their consistency, they have no means of attacking nor do they have
the ability to move. Anyone attempting to attack these creatures must roll a d20 to
hit, Due to the hard exterior of the monster, a weapon sustains one notch on any
roll of 18+. Once sufficient damage has been inflicted, the stones will turn to dust.
These rock formations are always found underground.

Skeleton

Skeletons are man-sized, bipedal undead. They are completely devoid of skin. Their
bones are usually white to dull gray in color. These undead monsters produce a
clattering sound as they move; this may be heard from a distance of up to 30’. They
possess Undead Vision with a range of 60". As is standard for the lesser undead,
Skeletons suffer 1 point of damage for every minute they are exposed to direct
sunlight.
Due to their skeletal form, these undead have an innate Armor Rating. They are
resistant to sharp or piercing weapons, and, if struck with such a weapon, the
Skeleton only suffers one-half the damage (always rounded down). On some
occasions, Skeletons have been encountered wearing padded or leather armor. When
wearing such protection, the Armor Rating of the monster is enhanced. Once the
armor is destroyed the monster returns to its unnatural 4 AR. The armor worn by
a Skeleton does not receive half damage from sharp or piercing attacks. Instead, it
absorbs the normal amount of damage until it is destroyed. Likewise, Skeletons

can carry shields that also increase their defensive values.

Skeletons carry weapons that they claimed from past victims. When wielding a weapon, the weapon type determines the damage inflicted by
the attack. However, an unarmed Skeleton attacks with its bony fist. This attack form inflicts 1d6 points of damage.
These creatures are the creations of Necromancers. The

detest all life and attack until they are destroyed. Althou h the

ground, most encounters with Skeletons occur in underground shrines or dungeons.

Skeleton, Giant

These abominations resemble regular Skeletons though they stand over 8' tall.
Their bones are thicker and more resistant than the smaller variety of Skeletons
and grant these abominations an unnatural Armor Rating of 5. These undead are
impervious to attacks made by sharp or piercing weapons. Only blunt weapons
cause them physical damage. They possess Undead Vision at a range of 70’. Like
other undead, Giant Skeletons suffer 1 point of damage per minute when exposed
to direct sunlight.
When engaged in melee combat, Giant Skeletons attack by flailing at their victims
with their clawed hands. This attack inflicts 3d4 points of damage. Due to their
size, they are incapable of wearing armor, although they have been encountered
carrying small or large shields. The protection increases their DV1 ratings.
Giant Skeletons are the creations of Necromancets. They are mindless and devoid
of any thought. Bent on the destruction of all life, they stay in battle until destroyed.
Because they are damaged by sunlight, these creatures are usually found serving as
guardians in dismal marshes or underground shrines.

Slime Dragon

These large, reptilian beasts are the horrible creations of Marda. Their 10' long
bodies are covered with blackish scales and their eyes glow a dim red color. They
possess Night Vision with a range of 60’ and can detect invisible creatures at a
distance of 20'. From their backs sprout great wings that allow them to fly at fast
speeds and their exceptional eyesight and olfactory senses make them impossible
to surprise.

Slime Dragons attack by means of a vicious bite. Their strong jaws and jagged,

sword-like teeth inflict damage equal to 6d4. In addition, once every 5 minutes,
the monster can breathe forth a blast of slime on a creature within 20’. This attack
requires a d20 roll to hit, though the Slime Dragon must only strike the victim's

DV2. If successful, the target sustains 3d4 points of actual damage. Furthermore,

the victim continues to sustain 3 points of actual damage each minute thereafter
until the thick, syrupy slime can be washed away. Cleansing requires 1 full minute,
and adequate water or alcohol must be available.

These terrible monsters are greatly feared by Humans and humanoids. They tend to live in high mountains or within dismal swamps. Like
Dragons and Hydras, these creatures horde wealth and their lairs are filled with gold, silver, and other treasures. By nature they tend to be
nocturnal creatures.

Snake, Giant

Giant Snakes are found in forests and other areas that support dense vegetation.

They are typically dark green to brown in color and blend naturally with their

environment. This camouflage makes them difficult to detect, allowing them to
surprise their enemies 50% of the time. On average, these reptiles reach a length of
10', though adventurers claim to have encountered much larger specimens.

These creatures attack by biting their prey. This bite inflicts 1d8 points of damage.
Due to their speed and natural offensive ability, they possess a 3 Attack Value.
Although the majority of these creatures are not poisonous, nearly 10% possess a
weak venom. This poison inflicts an additional 1d4 points of actual damage unless
the victim successfully makes a Saving Throw vs. Poison.
These giant reptiles generally eat rats, frogs, and other wildlife, but have been known
to assault humanoids when hungry or threatened. Like ordinary snakes, these
monsters swallow their prey whole. Because of this, it is possible to find small items
in the stomach of these beasts.

Monsters

Spider, Giant

Giant Spiders have thick, furry hides that grant them a natural Armor Rating. In
addition, These arachnids are almost 3’ in diameter and their bodies are bulbous
and hairy. They move exceptionally fast and can jump forward a distance of 30° or
upward 10’. In combat these creatures attack with their fangs. Although they only
inflict 1d4 points of damage, their bite is poisonous and requires the victim to
make a Saving Throw vs. Poison. A success indicates that there is no ill effect. A
failure, however, means the character suffers an additional 1d6 points of actual
damage.
In addition to their leaping ability and bite, Giant Spiders are capable of spinning
webs. Although these webs do not bind humanoids or large animals, they do affect
the speed of creatures. Movement through a Spider’s web is reduced to one quarter
the normal rate. Also, attacks per minute are lowered by a factor of 1. For example,
a character wielding a longsword is only able to attack 1 time every 2 minutes.
Giant Spiders attack any creature that enters their webs. When faced with superior
foes, these monsters seek to hide and return to their area once the danger has passed. They usually feed on rats, birds, Ebryns, and other small
animals, however, they will not hesitate from attacking humanoids as well.

Stamina Leech

This microscopic organism is related to the Power Tick and Duvadin and cannot

be detected with the naked eye. These parasites live in dank, stagnant waters and

attack humanoids that come in contact with the water where they live. Each minute
a humanoid is exposed, there is a 30% chance the creature is absorbed into the
bloodstream of the victim. Once absorbed, it begins draining the host of its Stamina

at a rate of .1d4 per hour. This draining directly affects the victim’s Hit Points.

When the infected creature’s Hit Points reach 0, it falls into a coma.

The only way to remove one of these creatures after it enters the host is through the
use of a Cure Disease spell. If successful, this magic instantly kills the parasite. Sages
have discovered, however, that casting the Purify Water spell on the watery lair of a
Stamina Leech has a 50% chance of destroying the creature before it can attack.
Once a victim is cured, his Stamina returns at a rate of 1 full point per day.

Stone Mimic

These horrific creatures are made from a gelatinous liquid and live within stone of
any sort. Their actual bodies are nearly three cubic feet and they possess the ability

to travel through rock. These monsters choose to live only a few centimeters within
stone walls and floors. When contacted by warm-blooded creatures, the monster

emerges from its hidden lair and strikes at its victim. If successful, the victim suffers
wounds equal to 1d6 points and is required to make a Saving Throw vs. Disease or
else become paralyzed. Although a successful Saving Throw negates the effects, a
failure indicates the character is instantly affected and is unable to move, attack, or

even speak. Immediately, the Stone Mimic begins to draw its prey into the stone
where it dwells. This process takes 5 minutes and inflicts 1d4 points of actual
damage each minute due to suffocation. When completed, the victim instantly
dies and there will be nothing left, its body will be hidden within the stone.

These creatures possess a natural Armor Rating of 6. They suffer full damage from
spells but only one-quarter damage from weapons during the time they are exposed
to the surface (when attacking and dragging someone inside their lair) but once inside the stone, they are immune to all weapons and spells.
Stone Mimics feast on the protein found within living things. Once prey is dragged into the stone, the creature begins to devour the victim with
its digestive fluids. Although it will dissolve skin, blood, and bone, it does not digest metal, cloth, or other materials. In fact, if the stone around

the lair of this creature is excavated, it is possible to find the items of previous victims.

Monsters

Tenant

Tenants are a form of sentient vegetation. Their general appearance resembles a
gelatinous mound, having a yellowish to white coloration. They feed on living
tissue and can sense blood at a distance of 20'. Since they are slow, they often
burrow into large wooden structures such as a dungeon door, large railing, wooden

floor, tree, etc. in order to surprise prey. To aid in their camouflage, Tenants secrete
a fluid that restores the wooden appearance of their lair. This cannot be detected
except by using the Plant ID skill. If the skill is used successfully, the character will
notice a swirling pattern on the wood surface. Due to its camouflage, the Tenant
has a natural Armor Rating of 4. In addition, since the creature is dispersed
throughout the wooden structure, it only sustains one-quarter damage from all
weapon types. It is very susceptible to fire, however, and sustains normal damage
from oil flasks and fire-based spells. Even holding an ordinary torch to the creature
will inflict 1d2 points of damage per application.
Tenants are attracted to blood and wait within their hidden lairs for unsuspecting

prey. As soon as a warm- blooded creature touches the infested wood, the monster lashes out and attacks. If the creature’s initial attack succeeds,

the Tenant punctures the victim with a barbed, twig-like appendage. This appendage inflicts 2 points of damage and entwines itself around the
skeletal structure of the victim, holding it stationary. The damage inflicted must be deducted from both the victim’s armor and actual Hit
Points. As long as the Tenant holds the creature, the appendage continuously grows underneath the victim's skin, seeking to find its heart or

brain. The creature continues to sprout new brambles that automatically puncture the victim. Each combat minute following the first attack,

the target suffers 2 additional points of damage. Binding kits will not heal any damage inflicted. Once a victim is slain, the Tenant quickly
devours its body. This takes only 1d4 hours to accomplish.
During the first four combat minutes, the victim may attempt to break free from the Tenant's grasp. To accomplish this, the victim must make

a 1d100 roll equal to 10% +1% for every full point of Strength. For each minute the creature is held, it suffers a -5% penalty to its chance of
escape. For example, a character with a 9.7 Strength would have a 19% chance of breaking free. The second combat minute he would only have
a 14% chance of gaining freedom, etc. After 4 minutes, the creature has enveloped the victim's body and no chance of escape is possible.
Once the Tenant is killed, the brambles within the victim’s body will cease to grow and begin to rot. This process negates the benefits of normal

sleeping (e.g. Hit Point restoration) for 3d6 days. In addition, the victim has a 20% chance of being afflicted with a natural disease. If this
occurs, the victim loses all benefits from sleeping until cured through the casting of a Berethenu Knight’s Cure Disease spell.

It is uncertain how these creatures reproduce. It is believed that they split after consuming large amounts of living matter. Therefore, it is
possible to find several Tenants in the same area. Due to their insidious nature, these creatures are greatly feared by adventurers.

Tendril

Tendrils are a form of sentient vegetation that thrive in dark, subterranean areas.

They appear as a patch of thick moss or fungus and may grow on any solid surface

such as a wall, floor, or ceiling. Although they appear harmless, Tendrils are extremely
aggressive creatures. They are carnivorous and have ravenous appetites. Though
they have no external sight organs, Tendrils can detect movement within 15’.

When a potential victim passes within 15' of a Tendril, the growth lashes out with
four tentacles. These appendages may be centered on a single opponent or multiple
opponents within range. Each attack is made with the equivalent of an 8 AV. A
successful hit indicates that the appendage has attached itself to the victim. Although
this does not cause any initial damage, each minute thereafter the Tendril secretes
digestive fluids through the appendage. These fluids are highly acidic and cause 1
point of damage to the victim per attached tentacle. This damage is deducted from
the victim's armor before causing any damage to its Hit Points. Also, the victim
sustains a -] Attack Value for every appendage that is attached.

A typical Tendril has at least 20 appendages. Even though they possess numerous amounts of tentacles, the creature is only able to attack with
four per combat minute. Each tentacle has its own Hit Points (15 + 1d6). Once sufficient damage is inflicted, the tentacle is severed and useless.
Appendages are regenerated at a rate of one per week. If an appendage successfully hits, the Tendril secretes its digestive fluids and attacks with

four other tentacles the following combat minute. Only five appendages may be attached to any one victim.

To kill the creature, damage must be inflicted on the actual growth, which has 60 + 3d6 Hit Points. Due to the slimy and rubbery nature of the
tentacles and the thick vegetation surrounding the Tendril’s organs, the creature possesses a natural 6 Armor Rating. Once sufficient damage is
inflicted on the growth, the creature dies. It is not uncommon to find the remains of previous victims hidden under the growth of the monster.

Terrical

Terricals are birds that inhabit tangled woods and marshes. Their bodies are covered

with feathers that range in color from light gray to dark brown. They possess an

average wingspan of 5'. Like wasps, Terricals have long stingers, which they use in
combat. Their speed and maneuverability grant them a natural 4 Armor Rating.
These animals are carnivorous, aggressive hunters. Terricals are encountered in groups
ranging between two to eight, but much larger flocks have been reported.

Whena Terrical enters combat, it uses its stinger as a weapon. Not only does the
stinger inflict 1d3 points of damage, it also secretes a venom. This poison serves as

a blood thinner, causing the wound to continually bleed until healed. The victim is
entitled to a Saving Throw vs. Poison for each hit. If successful, the victim suffers
no ill effects. If the Saving Throw fails, however, for each minute after the initial
hit, the victim loses 1 Hit Point due to blood loss. This effect is cumulative per
wound the victim receives. For example, if a Terrical strikes a victim three times,
and all the Saving Throws are failed, the victim would lose 3 Hit Points per minute
until healed. Also, since the wound is open and infected with poison, the only way to stop the bleeding is through the use of binding kits,
magical spells, or the administering of Jilda weed. Healing roots will only restore Hit Points, not close the wounds.

Troll

Trolls are large humanoids that stand 10’ tall. Their bodies are stone gray in color
and are covered with wiry hair. Trolls wander the lands in search of treasure and

prey. Since they are nomadic, they do not make lairs or settle in one place for very
long. They possess Night Vision with a 90' range.

In combat these creatures attack with their two fists. They are exceptionally strong,
enabling them to add +5 to their damage rolls. When attacking, a Troll is considered
to have a 10 AV. They have not been encountered using actual weapons, nor do

they wear armor. However, their naturally thick hide gives them a base AR of 8.

These monsters are carnivorous and have ravenous appetites. They devour anyone
or anything they encounter. Trolls are greatly feared by all humanoids. These
monsters enjoy combat and fight to the death in any encounter. Trolls are immune

to all fear-based attacks and are also immune to poisons.

Monsters

Tursk

Tursks are a species of snake that dwells in dense forests or dismal swamps. They
are aggressive hunters and attack potential prey with great ferocity. They tend to
have a dark green or brown coloration and an average length of 10’. Unlike normal
snakes, Tursks possess two large hooded heads.

During melee combat, a Tursk attacks by delivering two vicious bites. Each of
these bites inflict 2d6 damage. When engaged with an opponent, the heads of the

Tursk sway gently and rhythmically at the beginning of the combat minute. This

causes the creature to always strike last in the battle sequence, despite the initiative
rolled. When the creature does attack, it strikes with a 10 Attack Value due to its

agility and lightning fast reflexes. The body of the Tursk is covered in scales, which
contributes to their natural 5 Armor Rating.

Reports of these creatures indicate that specimens with three or even four heads

have been encountered, but these sightings are very rare.

Unicorn

These beautiful animals are usually encountered in dense forests or rolling plains.
They look like white horses except for the single horn that grows from their forehead.
This horn, which they use in combat, is made of ivory and is worth roughly 150
gold coins. Because they are shy, they shun all contact with humanoids.
In combat, these animals attack by trampling their opponent with their hooves. In

order to accomplish this, the Unicorn must be standing no less than 30° away and
must successfully hit the target’s DV2. If successful, the damage inflicted is equal

to 2d6 points. Two points are absorbed by the victim’s Armor Points while the rest
is deducted from its Hit Points. Their other form of attack is to impale opponents
with their horn. This inflicts 1d8 points of damage per attack.

Unicorns are shy and unobtrusive animals. They possess the ability of Hiding and
are 75% undetectable without the use of the Observation skill. When discovered,
they generally attempt to flee. They are one of the Marda’s first creations and display
the beautiful side of the otherwise destructive deity.

Vampire

These creatures are pure evil. They are the unnatural incarnation of a Necromancer
who has learned the processes necessary to transform herself into a powerful undead
creature. Vampires are creatures of darkness and suffer 5 Hit Points of damage for
every minute they are exposed to direct sunlight. Although they look Human,
their skin is pale white and their eyes are rimmed with a crimson red coloration.
They have Undead Vision that reaches 150’.

These monsters have several interesting abilities. First of all, they possess magical
abilities equal to that of a Necromancer. Vampires possess 95 Spell Points and do

not require spell components. They are adept spell casters, able to cast up to 6th

level spells, and suffer no harmful side effects. Each day they sleep, they regenerate
3 Hit Points of damage and regain 30 spell points. When not employing spells,
Vampires attack with their fangs, which inflict 1d4 points of actual damage. In
addition, the opponent must make a Saving Throw versus Disease, or else be inflicted
with Leprosy. Leprosy will cause the victim to lose 1 Hit Point per minute until
cured through the use of a Cure Disease spell, or until he dies. If a Human is killed

in this manner, the victim’s body becomes a Vohl within 3d4 hours. This creature is under the complete control of the Vampire. In addition to

spell use and melee attacks, Vampires are capable of transforming themselves into bats, thus gaining the ability of flight with a speed of 8.

Retaining some of their former intelligence, Vampires are cunning and resourceful. They use their spell abilities of Animation and Undead
Domination to create minions for their protection. In combat, they use their magical talents to fight or escape depending on the circumstances.

During the daytime hours, Vampires lose their ability to cast spells. This is when they are the most vulnerable. These creatures are the most
powerful form of undead that exist.
Monsters

195

Voht

These abominations appear as emaciated humanoids, Their faces possess Human

features, but are deformed and twisted. The mouth of a Vohl is extended, filled

with sharp teeth and two long fangs. Although they are 6' tall, Vohls are
hunchbacked. Their arms are long, usually reaching a length of 3 or more feet.
In battle, Vohls attack with their clawed hands and also deliver a dreadful bite.
Each claw attack inflicts 1d6 points of damage. More fearsome however, is their

bite, which drains 1d2 Hit Points from the victim unless he successfully makes a
Saving Throw vs. Death. This loss is permanent and the Hit Points should be

deducted immediately. The only way to regain the lost points is to kill the Vohl
responsible and drink its ichor. This is very dangerous for the creature’s blood is
extremely poisonous. When consumed, a Saving Throw vs. Poison must be made

at a -2 or the imbiber instantly dies. If successful, the character regains all of the
Hit Points that he lost, but may not exceed his maximum total. The ichor quickly
spoils once exposed to the air. If not consumed within 1 hour, all effects are lost.

Vohls are immune to poisons, fear and mind affecting spells. They possess Undead Vision with a maximum range of 120'. Direct sunlight
causes them physical pain and inflicts 3 point of damage per minute they are exposed.

Werewolf

Werewolves are humanoid creatures covered with long fur. Their facial features are
distinctly wolf-like. They possess acute olfactory senses, enabling them to use the
Tracking skill with 80% accuracy. Although they have sharp teeth, a Werewolf
attacks with both of their razor sharp claws. Each successful hit inflicts 1d8 points
of damage and has a 10% chance of afflicting the victim with the disease known as
Lycanthropy. If the disease is transmitted, the victim is entitled to a Saving Throw
vs. Disease. Success indicates the character suffers no ill effects.
These monsters feed on humanoids of all kinds. Due to their thick hides, they have
a natural 5 AR. They are aggressive and pursue prey for long periods of time.
Werewolves are creatures of magical nature and are partially immune to non-magical
weapons. When attacked with such items, the creature only sustains 1/4 damage.
Magical weapons and spells, however, inflict normal damage.
Those afflicted with Lycanthropy soon become aware of the disease’s effects. At
night they become agitated and easily angered. They enter into fits of rage without
provocation. Every night there is a 1% cumulative chance that the character enters into an episode of insatiable violence. During this time the
afflicted character will attack any humanoid creature that comes within sight. Although he retains his normal appearance, skills, and abilities,
he is unable to remember anything that occurred during the episode. Only a Cure Disease spell can cure character.
After seven such episodes, the character will transform into a Werewolf and all knowledge, skills and abilities are lost. Even the casting of a Cure
Disease spell will be in vain. Although these creatures are partially immune to non-magical weapons, a hit with a silver- tipped bolt fired from

a heavy crossbow will automatically kill the beast. When killed, the Werewolf reverts to its natural form.

Wolf

These carnivorous animals are found in almost every terrain and climate. They are
usually encountered in packs that roam large areas in search of prey. They are very
fast runners, but are only capable of maintaining their maximum speed for 10
minutes. Due to their heightened olfactory sense, Wolves are proficient at Tracking
with an 85% base chance of success. They only attack when hungry, so there is a
75% chance that they will leave humanoids alone. These animals are afraid of fire
and can be held at bay if confronted with a flaming torch or branch.
When Wolves do attack, they use their powerful jaws. Their bite inflicts 2d4
points of damage. They have an Attack Value of 3 and their hides are fairly thick,
granting these beasts a Armor Rating of 3.

196

Monsters

Wolf, Sabre

Sabre Wolves are found in frozen tundra and snow covered terrains. They have
thick hides that are pure white in coloration. Much larger than other wolves, these

creatures inflict great damage with their bite. Having an Attack Value of 4, they are

aggressive combatants, each hit inflicting 3d4 points of damage. In addition, Sabre
Wolves are not afraid of fire. Their hides, thicker than those of normal wolves,
grant them an Armor Rating of 4.
Like normal Wolves, these creatures travel in packs ranging between five to eight.

They are always hungry and will attack without hesitation. Due to their size, they
are not susceptible to the 2nd level Animal Domination spell of Beast Mages.

Monsters

197

Yeti

Yetis are a race of humanoids that dwell in arctic regions or high on the peaks of
snow-covered mountains. Their massive frames reach a height of 7 feet and their
bodies are covered with thick fur, granting them a natural Armor Rating of 6. In
combat, these creatures attack twice per round with their fearsome claws. Each hit
inflicts 1d10 +1 points of damage due to their iron-like claws and exceptional

Strength. They are aggressive opponents and possess an Attack Value of 7.

In addition to their natural defense value, Yetis are immune to all cold-based attacks,

magical or otherwise. They are carnivorous and attack anything they encounter.

They eat Frost Heaves, which are native to their natural habitat. During the coldest
of winter months, Yetis have been encountered within the civilized lands surrounding

their normal lairs. Although they are immune to cold-based attacks, they are

susceptible to fire and sustain 1 additional point per damage die rolled. Thus, an
oil flask would inflict 2d6 +2 points of damage.
In their society, both males and females have been encountered. Both follow the

same general characteristics as listed previously. Young Yeti, however, possess an Attack Value of 4 and inflict only 1d6 points of damage with
their claws. Yetis speak their own language.

Zombie

Zombies appear as rotting corpses. They are always mansized and are physically grotesque. Their bodies are
covered with patches of leprous skin that is leathery to
the touch. Their method of movement is a staggering
walk, which makes them very slow.
When attacking, these undead creatures flail at their

opponents with their two fists. Each attack delivers 1d4

points of damage. Due to their unnatural condition, their

leathery skin protects them from damage, making them
more resistant to blunt attacks. If struck by a blunt

weapon, a Zombie suffers one-half the damage inflicted.

They possess Undead Vision at a range of 60'. When
exposed to direct sunlight, these creatures suffer 1 point

of damage per minute due to their unnatural existence.

Zombies are mindless. They were once humanoid and
were animated by Necromancers. Since they are destroyed
by sunlight, it is rare to find these creatures above the
ground, unless in the servitude ofa Mage. They are usually
encountered in marshes or underground shrines.
