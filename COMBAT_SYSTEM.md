## üîß Technical Details

### Combat Resolution Formula
```
Attack Roll = 1d20 + Attack Value + Skill Bonus
Hit if: Attack Roll > Target Defense Value OR Natural 20

Damage = Weapon Dice + Damage Bonus + Skill Bonus
Actual HP Damage = Dice Count (excess absorbed by armor)
Critical Hit = Double damage + double dice count
```

### Skill Advancement
```
Pips Needed = Current Skill Level + 1
Successful Use = +1 Pip
Level Up when: Pips >= Pips Needed
Reset pips to 0 after level up
```

### Experience System
```
Creature XP = HP + Attack Value + Defense Value
Character Level Up = (Level + 1) * 100 XP
Level Benefits = +5 Max HP, restored to full
```
